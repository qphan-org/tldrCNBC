# To-do List

[ ] Check if the color scheme is appropriate

[ ] Create a way to store db json files temporary in tldrcnbc server, instead of having to request from the MongoDB database --> cut down cost. (Note that there are some programings out there keep requesting response (aka scraping) from tldrcnbc.com, causing a spike in cost to run the website to $5 per day)

[ ] Create a log function that log all the DB request for analytics, and maybe log the ip address of requests too.
