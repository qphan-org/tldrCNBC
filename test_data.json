    "content": "ETFs are seeing a record surge in popularity.\nThe industry hit a milestone with more than 3,000 ETFs trading simultaneously for the first time ever this month — a 30% increase since December 2020, according to Morningstar.\nAnd this year investors are taking more active strategies, such as single-stock ETFs that offer traders exposure to the daily performance of a singular stock like Tesla or Apple.\n\"We started off with basically taking very broad index funds — SPY [SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust] was the first one — and then the industry over the years built all these interesting overlays,\" Nick Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, told Bob Pisani on CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" this week.\nIncluded were sector and emerging funds, as well as funds specified to themes such as clean energy and legal marijuana, Colas said, as part of a shift from disruptive innovation to mainstream.\n\"Investors now are really spoiled for choice among just being able to pick not only the big sector funds or the big overall funds but any kind of fund they think might be interesting,\" he added.\nHowever, this move toward specificity of thematic ETFs like cybersecurity ETFs has its risks, according to investment consultant Charles Ellis, the author of two upcoming books, \"Inside Vanguard\" and \"Figuring It Out.\" While Ellis believes those who go into ETFs to later dive into index funds will do fine, those choosing highly specialized ETFs are at risk of making disastrous mistakes.\n\"The more you get specific, the more the odds are high that you won't be able to make a rational long-term decision and you will get suckered into making, because we're all human beings, an emotional short-term decision, and you won't like the outcome in the long run,\" Ellis said.\nWith quick growth in the number of ETFs, investors will soon celebrate another milestone. In January 2023, the first ETF — SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust — will turn 30 years old. Now the largest ETF and one of the world's largest funds, SPY is valued at $350 billion in assets under management. \nColas said SPY was exactly the right product to start with, unlike emerging market ETFs which had lousy returns after its boom and bust cycle.\nThe growth of ETFs and more active funds stems in part from people in mediocre mutual funds converting to ETFs, said Pisani. Colas said there are fewer associated fees with ETFs than mutual funds, as well as less of a tax liability."

    "content": "Earlier this month, S&P Global released its \"SPIVA U.S. Mid-Year 2022\" report, highlighting the state of active management and how it performs against their benchmark. Despite this being the best year so far, the report found that 51% of large-cap active fund managers are underperforming. \nAnd for the long term, the shortcomings balloon even further: 84% underperform after five years, and 90% do so after 10 years.\n\"The function of any market is to find the right price and make it available to people who want to buy or sell,\" Charley Ellis, author of \"Winning the Loser's Game,\" told CNBC's Bob Pisani on \"ETF Edge\" on Monday.\n\"When I came out of Harvard Business School in 1963, there were no courses on investment management. Now there's seven,\" he added. \"And trading volume on the NYSE was 3 million shares, now it's somewhere between 6 and 8 billion shares a day.\"\nEllis said that the increase in the number of people getting involved in active investing over time, along with greater access to market knowledge, has made it easier for investors to do professional trading on their own. \n\"Anytime you go into the market as an active manager, you're buying from and selling to other people that know exactly what you know, just as fast as you know it,\" he said. \"That makes it awfully hard to get ahead of anybody else.\"\nAmid the current volatility that's influenced by a number of factors, markets are especially more unpredictable regardless of the information an investor is privy to. \n\"It's important to remember that efficient market theory doesn't say markets are priced correctly every day,\" Nick Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, said in the same segment. \"It says that there's no reliable way to find the mispricing, and that's still true. And that is why active management is so hard.\"\nColas said that there's no consistent method to establish outperformance of benchmarks, so it's up to individual investors to create their own strategies or seek out an active manager to assist.\n\"Every great investor has one phenomenal idea,\" he said. \"A phenomenal idea that people didn't believe for a long time. And that's been proven true.\"\nWhile active management might be better suited for laborious strategies like playing the bond market, the lines between active and passive are becoming more blurred.\n\"There's actually no such thing as passive management,\" Colas said. \"Everything, including buying an index fund is still a choice. Those choices are informed by emotion, and that is something that we battle a lot\"\nOn the topic of indexed funds, Colas also advised to not take active management for granted. He said that he encourages his clients to look at longer-term trends on a global scale.\nFor example, Colas recommended comparing the S&P and Russell indexes to emerging market ETFs. EFA and EEM are up 3% a year for the last 10 years, he said, and the S&P is up 10% in that time period.\n\"We recommend underweighting [EFA and EEM] as dramatically as you can possibly stand,\" Colas said. \"Because those are not moneymaking areas and, according to the current structure, they never will be.\""

    "content": "The stock price of SPAC company Digital World Acquisition Corp. skyrocketed on extremely heavy trading volume Thursday after news of a merger that would launch former President Donald Trump's planned social media platform.\nDWAC's stock surged 356.8% to close at $35.54 per share. Trading in the SPAC was halted multiple times due to volatility. At one point, the stock was up more than 400% to hit a high of $52.\nDigital World Acquisition was the single most actively traded stock on the Fidelity platform Thursday, and was by far the most traded name on the consolidated tape of New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq listings.\nDWAC is a so-called special purpose acquisition company set up to raise capital in the public markets to purchase private firms.\nMore than 470 million shares of DWAC changed hands during Thursday's session, according to FactSet. In comparison, SPY, the exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P 500, only traded about 32 million shares.\nIn a press release Wednesday night, Trump's new company, Trump Media & Technology Group, said it and DWAC \"have entered into a definitive merger agreement, providing for a business combination that will result in Trump Media & Technology Group becoming a publicly listed company, subject to regulatory and stockholder approval.\"\nTrump also said he would roll out a platform called \"TRUTH Social,\" which he claimed will \"stand up to the tyranny of Big Tech.\"\nTrump has been banned by social media giants Twitter and Facebook since early this year after he was accused of inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol riot by a mob of his supporters. The violence interrupted the confirmation of Trump's Electoral College loss to President Joe Biden.\nBefore the ban, Trump had been a compulsive user of Twitter, often sending out multiple tweets per day during his presidency. Since the ban, Trump has struggled to get his off-the-cuff brickbats against political foes heard in the mass media.\nTrump earlier this month asked a federal judge in Florida to force Twitter to restore his account there.\nIn the press release Wednesday night, the ex-president's new company said its \"mission is to create a rival to the liberal media consortium and fight back against the 'Big Tech' companies of Silicon Valley, which have used their unilateral power to silence opposing voices in America.\"\nDigital World Acquisition was incorporated in late 2020, shortly after Trump lost a reelection bid against Biden.\nThe ticker DWAC was among the top 10 most popular names on Reddit's WallStreetBets chatroom Thursday, even exceeding meme stock GameStop's mentions, according to alternative data provider Quiver Quantitative.\nThat could be a sign that retail investors active on social media platforms were fueling the rally in the SPAC.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the level of trading in the SPAC.\nThe planned merger values Trump Media & Technology Group \"at an initial enterprise value of $875 Million, with a potential additional earnout of $825 Million in additional shares (at the valuation they are granted) for a cumulative valuation of up to $1.7 Billion depending on the performance of the stock price post-business combination,\" the press release Wednesday said.\n\"Trump Media & Technology Group's growth plans initially will be funded by DWAC's cash in trust of $293 Million (assuming no redemptions),\" according to the release.\nThursday's rally could mean massive returns for insiders involved in the deal, including a handful of hedge funds. D.E. Shaw owned 8% of the SPAC, or 2.4 millions of shares, while ARC Capital held a near 18% stake, or 6.6 million shares, according to regulatory filings. Saba Capital Management, Highbridge Capital Management and Lighthouse Investment Partners were also big early investors of the SPAC.\nA corporate overview of Trump's new company does not list any officers, employees, or operations.\nInstead, the 22-page slideshow contains several graphics showing how many followers Trump had on Twitter before he was banned, and suggestions that the new venture will compete with both Disney+ and Netflix.\nPatrick Orlando, CEO of DWAC, in the press release said, \"Digital World was formed to create public shareholder value and we believe that TMTG is one of the most promising business combination partners to fulfill that purpose.\"\n\"Given the total addressable market and President Trump's large following, we believe the TMTG opportunity has the potential to create significant shareholder value,\" Orlando said.\nThe release also said that \"TMTG intends to launch a subscription video on demand service\" called TMTG+.\n\"TMTG+ will feature 'non-woke' entertainment programming, news, podcasts, and more,\" the release said.\nOrlando, who graduated from MIT, spent five years at Deutsche Bank, where he worked with emerging markets fixed income derivatives. \nOrlando later moved into the South American sugar industry and is currently involved with at least three other SPACs, or so-called blank-check companies: Yunhong International, Benessere Capital Acquisition and Maquia Capital Acquisition.\nOrlando is also CEO of Yunhong International, which was incorporated in the Cayman Islands in 2020 and which lists its headquarters in Wuhan, China. \nThe city of Wuhan is also the origin point of the coronavirus, which causes Covid-19, the pandemic disease that has ravaged the world for the past two years.\nBoth as president and since then, Trump has referred to Covid as \"The Wuhan virus,\" and insisted the pathogen was deliberately released from a Wuhan virology lab.\nHe has also demanded China pay reparations to the world for the damage wrought by the virus.\nIn May, Yunhong International announced it had reached a deal to take a Chinese green energy company, Giga Energy, public. But that deal fell apart, and Giga Energy terminated its agreement with Yunhong last month.\nThe chief financial officer of Digital World Acquisition is Luis Orleans-Braganza, a member of Brazil's parliament and a supporter of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro.\nOrleans-Braganza is also a member of Brazil's defunct royal family, which has not been in power since the country became a republic in the late 19th century.\nBut members of the family still pretend to be royalty. Orleans-Braganza himself has proposed an amendment to Brazil's constitution that would create a fourth branch of government, a move that many observers see as an attempt to begin reinstalling a monarchy in Brazil.\n- Additional reporting by CNBC's Thomas Franck"

    "content": "It was a historic day on Wall Street. The Dow plunged 10% for its worst day since Black Monday in 1987. The 30-stock index fell 2,352 points —  its largest point drop on record. Meanwhile the S&P 500 plunged 9% to close in bear market territory, thus officially ending the bull market that began in 2009 during the throes of the financial crisis.\nHere's what happened:\nThursday's market by the numbers:\nThe Nasdaq Composite tanked 9.4% Thursday, its biggest drop since April 2000 before the burst of the dot-com bubble. Liberty TripAdvisor, Full House Resorts and Eldorado Resorts were among the biggest losers in the tech-heavy index, falling more than 35% each. The so-called FANG stocks including Netflix, Facebook and Google-parent company Alphabet all plunged more than 8% Thursday. - Li\nWith Thursday's historic plunge, the record-long stock market bull run has officially ended. The S&P 500 tanked 9.5%, falling into bear market territory, or more than 20% from its recent peak. The Dow also suffered its worst point drop ever and the biggest percentage decline since 1987. - Li\nOccidental Petroleum was the only stock in the S&P 500 to close in positive territory as the broader index fell 9.5% to join Dow Jones Industrial Average in bear market territory. Occidental Petroleum gained .09% to close at $11.89. On Wednesday the stock dropped 17% after the company slashed its dividend, and shares are down 72% over the last month. - Stankiewicz\nStock losses accelerated into the close as stocks plummeted to their lowest levels in the final minute of trading. The Dow tanked 2,352 points for a 10% drop, its largest single day decline since the Oct. 1987 crash. The S&P 500 dropped 9.5%, closing in bear market territory, or more than 20% below its recent high. The Nasdaq dropped 9.4%. - Stevens, Li\nRising Treasury yields typically mean investors are ditching the security of bonds because of an improving economic outlook or in anticipation of more inflation, causing bond prices to dip and yields to rise. The opposite has been true for most of this coronavirus market rout with bond yields collapsing as fears of a global recession send investors crowding into the safety of bonds.\nBut something odd is happening now. 10-year and 30-year Treasuries are falling in value amid the Dow's worst day since 1987. This may hint at something more insidious, some traders said.\nIf equity losses accelerate to the point where investors start to worry about the health of their firms, they often are forced to sell safe U.S. debt in the hopes of stockpiling cash. That selling drives up rates.\nThe spike in long-term rates means \"the market is liquidating and we know the market is liquidating equities,\" said Ian Lyngen, head of rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets. \"The fact it is now liquidating longer dated Treasurys suggests the rush to go to cash is significant and it is the type of liquidity problem were the Fed needs to be more aggressive.\" — Franck, Domm\nThere are now nine S&P 500 sectors trading in bear market territory, or more than 20% below recent highs. Energy is by far the biggest laggard, trading 51% below its 52-week high. The financials sector is the second worst performer, down 33% from its high. The two sectors not in a bear market are health care and staples, but each is 18% below its high, putting both in correction territory and on the cusp of a bear market. - Stevens\nThe Cboe Volatility Index rose more than 18 points to break above 70 on Thursday, its highest level since the financial crisis, as the wild stretch of trading continues. The index, often called Wall Street's \"fear gauge,\" measures the potential future moves of the S&P 500 implied by the options market. The VIX spent most of 2019 below 20. — Pound\n\nRBC Capital markets just slashed its S&P 500 year-end price target to 3,279 from 3,460, representing a 1.5% gain on the index in 2020. \"\"Embedded in our new target is the idea that the brunt of the pain that the US equity market will experience due to the coronavirus will occur early in the year, with the bulk of the economic impact coming mid year, and a recovery trade taking hold once the news flow around the coronavirus improves,\" said the firm's head of U.S. equity strategy Lori Calvasina. RBC also upgraded the health care sector to overweight from market weight, given the group of stocks \"continues to look deeply undervalued relative to the S&P 500.\" – Fitzgerald\nThe Dow is now back down 2,000 points, after a brief respite on the Fed's funding actions. Traders remained jittery about the spreading coronavirus. In the latest, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced a ban on gatherings of 500 or more people as public officials try to contain the outbreak.— Li\nThe Senate will cancel its recess planned for next week as Congress tries to pass a plan to respond to the effects of the coronavirus outbreak, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday. \"Notwithstanding the scheduled state work period, the Senate will be in session next week,\" the Kentucky Republican said in a tweet. \"I am glad talks are ongoing between the Administration and Speaker Pelosi. I hope Congress can pass bipartisan legislation to continue combating the coronavirus and keep our economy strong.\" — Fitzgerald \nBillionaire Mark Cuban said on CNBC's \"Halftime Report\" that he bought shares in Twitter on Thursday even though he is unsure when the market will start to bounce back. He said investors should keep in mind the rally that stocks have been on over the past year. \"In reality, we're just back where we were 13 months ago,\" Cuban said. \"We didn't get upset or excited when it went up fast, and we shouldn't get excited when it goes down fast. We haven't hit a level that is really out of line.\" — Pound\nThe SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) is close to wiping out losses in heavy trade after the Fed announces new funding actions. KRE was last down 0.4% -- Francolla\n\nStocks cut losses after the New York Fed said it will conduct purchases across a range of maturities. It will offer $500 billion in a three-month repo operation at 1:30 pm ET. The Fed is also expanding Treasury purchases beyond bills. \"Specifically, the Desk plans to distribute reserve management purchases across eleven sectors, including nominal coupons, bills, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, and Floating Rate Notes,\" it said. The Dow was down about 1,200 points after plunging more than 2,200 points at its low. — Li\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 plummeted 11% Thursday, posting its worst one-day drop in history. The plunge came after the European Central Bank decided Thursday not to cut interest rates, disappointing investors who were expecting a reduction in borrowing cost. Meanwhile, Trump said the U.S. will suspend all travel from most of Europe for 30 days to curb the spread of coronavirus. -- Li\nThe Dow is now down more than 9%, putting it on pace for its largest one-day decline since the 1987 crash. - Stevens\nLosses accelerated in late morning trading with the Dow dropping to a new session low, down more than 2,200 points for a loss of more than 9%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are each down more than 8%. - Stevens\nFormer Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, who knows a little something about risk management after navigating that institution through the financial crisis, had some advice on what the U.S. government should do now to combat the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"Good risk management: at this point, go all-in on social separation, and all-in on financial relief to those most economically vulnerable (individuals and sm biz),\" Blankfein said in a tweet. \"Save the second guessing for later. I would welcome if we look back 3 months from now and think we over-reacted.\" - Melloy\nTweet\nPresident Donald Trump said that markets will be \"just fine\" Thursday, as stocks sold off in yet another dramatic session fueled by worries over the coronavirus outbreak and the administration's response to it. Trump's remarks Thursday came as he met with Leo Vardakar, the taoiseach of Ireland. At Capitol Hill, lawmakers were battling over what steps to take next to combat the rapidly spreading and deadly disease. House Republicans made it clear that they won't support the new emergency aid bill unveiled by Democrats, at least not in its current form. – Calia, Breuninger\nEuropean Central Bank President Christine Lagarde called the coronavirus \"a major shock\" to the global economy and called upon fiscal authorities to help combat the pandemic. For its part, the ECB on Thursday announced more stimulus but held its policy rate at current levels. Lagarde sad officials chose not to cut rates as they consider asset purchases and increased lending efforts to be \"the most efficient response\" to the current crisis. She also said the world shouldn't be looking to central banks to lead the way. \"I don't think anybody should expect any central bank to be the line of first response. It's fiscal first and foremost,\" she said in a news conference after the bank met. – Cox\nAll 11 S&P 500 sectors are sharply lower, with energy and financials leading the declines, down 9.9% and 8.8%, respectively. The utilities, materials, discretionary and industrials sectors are all down more than 8%. The relative outperformer is health care, which is only down 5.8%. – Stevens\nA little more than an hour into trading, and 324 S&P 500 components have already fallen to their lowest level in at least a year. The names include Facebook, Best Buy, Chipotle, Colgate and Tyson Foods. - Hayes, Stevens\nShortly after trading was halted around 9:38 a.m. ET, CNBC's Jim Cramer took a phone call live on television on \"Squawk on the Street.\" After the call, he said he believes the government is debating some big options to tackle the economic and financial markets crisis arising from the coronavirus pandemic.\"I think that's about to change,\" Cramer said about the uncertainty over what further actions the Trump administration may take to deal with the coronavirus fallout. \"I do believe that they'll enact some of the ideas I just talked about earlier.\" – Li, Belvedere\nAbout 73 stocks at the New York Stock Exchange fell for every one advancer as global markets got roiled by worries over slower economic growth due to the coronavirus spread. About 2,940 stocks traded lower while just over 40 advanced. - Imbert\nAs global markets fall, the Euro STOXX 600 is down 9.15%, putting it on track for its worst day ever. For the week it's currently down 18%, on track for its steepest weekly loss since Oct. 2008. - Francolla, Stevens\nThe Dow has lost 4,300 points so far this week, and is on pace for its worst weekly point loss ever. It is not, however, the 30-stock index's worst week in terms of a percentage drop. So far it's down 15.9% on the week, which puts it on track for its steepest weekly loss since Oct. 2008. - Francolla, Stevens\nThere were a ton of stock calls on Thursday as analysts try to pick winners and losers amid crisis.\nCNBC Pro subscribers can read more here. — Bloom\nThe Cboe Volatility Index, a measure of the 30-day implied volatility of the S&P 500 known as the \"VIX\" or the \"fear gauge,\" popped to 65.6 in morning trading Thursday. This level was only last seen at the height of the financial crisis more than a decade ago. -- Li\n\nNone of the stocks in the S&P 500 were above Wednesday's closing price when trading was halted at 9:35 a.m., according to FactSet. The biggest decliners were Royal Caribbean at -24.3%, Norwegian Cruise Lines at -20.4%, and Live Nation at -17.5%. — Pound\nThe market reopened after a 15-minute halt. The S&P 500 added to its losses, now down 7.4%.— Li\nThe level-one circuit breaker was triggered minutes into the opening bell after the S&P 500 dropped 7%. Trading is halted for 15 minutes until 9:50 am ET. — Li\nThe stock rout deepened on Thursday with the S&P 500 opening the session off 6.6%, joining the Dow in bear market territory. The 30-stock benchmark plunged 1,700 points at the open, while the Nasdaq tanked 6.9%. A key market-wide circuit breaker will trip once the S&P 500 falls 7%. — Li\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), which tracks the S&P 500, is still trading in premarket, while futures on the Dow, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 all traded at the so-called limit down threshold, off by 5%. The SPY is now down 7%. If the S&P 500 tanks the same amount when the markets open, a key \"circuit breaker\" will be triggered, resulting in a 15-minute halt in trading. — Li\nShares of Carnival fell to more than 21% below Wednesday's closing price in premarket trading after announcing that its Princess Cruise Lines would pause its shipping operations for 60 days. Trading was halted shortly before the announcement. There have been confirmed cases of the coronavirus on multiple Princess ships. — Pound\nThe European Central Bank kept interest rates unchanged in its policy decision Thursday, despite market expectations for a reduction amid the coronavirus outbreak. The central bank did announce measures to support bank lending, and expanded its quantitative easing (QE) program by 120 billion euros ($135.28 billion). – Li\nThe SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF SPY, which tracks the S&P 500 index and continues trading even if futures are halted, is now down more than 6.6%. The Invesco QQQ, which tracks the Nasdaq-100, is down more than 6.2%. This suggests that the Street is in for steeper losses than the 5% drop futures registered before reaching the so-called limit-down level. - Stevens\nOn Wednesday the Dow closed 1,464 points lower. It was the 30-stock index's seventh 1,000-plus point swing in either direction over the last 13 trading sessions. - Stevens, Rattner\nU.S. footwear imports from China just had their worst January in more than a decade as the industry suffered the double whammy from the trade war and the coronavirus outbreak. China is the biggest manufacturer of footwear in the U.S, as 70% of shoes sold here come from the developing country. Shares of Nike tanked 8.5% in premarket trading, set to extend a massive sell-off this year that's seen the stock plunge 17%. - Li\nStocks are set to plummet when the market opens in less than an hour. Earlier futures on the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 all dropped below 5%, which is the so-called limit down threshold. Once futures fall that much, exchanges halt trading of futures contracts, which acts as a floor for selling until regular trading resumes at the opening bell at 9:30 a.m. The SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY), which tracks the S&P 500 index and continues trading even if futures are halted, is down 5.2%. - Stevens\nShares of cruise operator Carnival Corp. were halted for trading due to news pending. Earlier in premarket trading the stock dropped more than 15% as the coronavirus outbreak continues to hit the travel industry. The CDC has warned that those at higher risk, including older adults, should avoid cruise travel. Shares of carnival have lost more than half their value in the last month, falling just over 50%. - Stevens\nThe U.S. stock market will drop as much as 30% from last month's highs as global economies go into coronavirus-driven recessions, said Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic advisor at Allianz, who correctly predicted earlier in the week the selling would continue until a bear market was reached. The former CEO of investment powerhouse Pimco said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday that investors should not expect a quick recovery in stocks when a bottom is finally reached. \"We are going into a global recession. We are going to see a spread of economic sudden stops,\" El-Erian said. \"The trouble with economic sudden stops is it's not easy to restart an economy. You've got to get people to re-engage. You've got to coordinate the restart. The economic damage is going to last.\" - Stankiewicz\nThe SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY), which tracks the S&P 500, is down 5.2% during Thursday's premarket trading as the sell-off intensifies. The S&P 500 is on track to enter a bear market when trading begins. - Stevens\nIndustrials crown jewel Boeing was on track Thursday morning to open more than 14% below where it closed on Wednesday, adding to its whopping 49% decline over the last six months. Boeing equity on Wednesday suffered its worst day on Wall Street since 1974 — an 18% plunge — after the planemaker said it was immediately suspending hiring and imposing measures to conserve cash.The company, already grappling with the fallout of two fatal crashes of its 737 Max craft, came under additional pressure over night after President Donald Trump said the U.S. will ban travelers from Europe for 30 days starting on Friday in an effort to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. — Franck\nThe brutal sell-off in the futures market Thursday signaled a so-called circuit breaker could be triggered when the markets open. A market trading halt may occur at \"three circuit breaker thresholds\" on the S&P 500 due to large declines and volatility, which helps keep stocks from a free fall. If the S&P 500 drops 7%, trading will pause for 15 minutes. Just on Monday, trading was halted temporarily minutes into the opening bell. The S&P 500 ended up suffering its worst day since the financial crisis at the beginning of the week. - Li\nAirline stocks were under pressure in Thursday's premarket trading after President Trump imposed a 30-day ban on foreigners arriving from most of Europe. American Airlines and United Airlines were both down more than 15%, while Delta Air Lines slid 13%. Travel stocks have gotten slammed as the coronavirus outbreak has hit demand. – Stevens\nCME Group announced Wednesday night it will close its Chicago trading floor in a precautionary move due to the coronavirus pandemic. The closing will take effect Friday \"at the close of business,\" CME said in a statement, noting that no coronavirus cases have been reported at the Chicago Board of Trade trading floor. This would make CME the first major U.S. exchange to close a trading floor due to concerns over the coronavirus. – Fitzgerald\nFutures contracts tied to the S&P 500 showed that the major market index is on track to join the Dow in bear market territory at the opening of trade on Thursday. Though an official bear market is determined on a closing basis, the S&P 500 is on track to slide 4.7% based on premarket futures trading. That would put the index 22.88% below its record close of 3,386.15 hit on Feb. 19.\nThe Dow, meanwhile, is poised to fall further into a bear market one day after its historic, 11-year bull market run came to an end on Wednesday. Futures showed the blue-chip index on track to dive 1,200 points, or 5%, at the opening bell. — Franck\nPresident Donald Trump gave a speech on Wednesday evening, announcing a ban on travelers to the United States from Europe, in an attempt to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. The ban is in place for the next 30 days. Trump also announced that he would ask Congress for legislative action to provide payroll tax relief, as well as other measures for several groups impacted by the virus. In addition to legislation, Trump said he would instruct the Small Business Administration to \"provide capital and liquidity\" to small businesses. - Fitzgerald\nAcademy Award-winning actor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson have tested positive for the coronavirus, Hanks said Wednesday. \"Hello, folks. Rita and I are down here in Australia,\" he wrote. \"We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too. To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the Coronavirus, and were found to be positive.\" Hanks and Wilson are in Australia for the pre-production of a Warner Bros. film. – Fitzgerald\nInvestors were left wanting more robust fiscal stimulus measures after President Donald Trump's speech Wednesday night. Trump said the administration would provide financial relief for workers who are ill, caring for others due to the virus or are quarantined. But Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report, said none of the measures announced \"are a silver bullet for coronavirus, and as such the market is reacting with short term disappointment.\" Ernie Tedeschi of Evercore ISI said Trump didn't \"offer up major new ideas on stimulus and only said he'd propose a vague payroll tax holiday to Congress without strongly standing up for any firm size/magnitude.\" —Imbert\nThe National Basketball Association on Wednesday night suspended its season indefinitely after a Utah Jazz player tested positive for the new coronavirus. \"The NBA is suspending game play following the conclusion of [Wednesday night's] schedule of games until further notice,\" the league said in a statement. \"The NBA will use this hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic.\" The National Hockey League said that it is \"continuing to consult with medical experts and is evaluating the options\" for its ongoing season. – Fitzgerald\nU.S. stock futures are pointing to steep losses at the open, one day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell into a bear market. The 30-stock index is set to drop 1,080 points when stocks open on Wall Street for a loss of 4.6%. The S&P 500 is set to open down 4.3%, while the Nasdaq is on track to drop 4.5%. \nBased on that decline, the S&P 500 will join the Dow in bear market territory.\nThe leg lower comes after President Donald Trump failed to assuage fears of a potential economic slowdown during a speech on Wednesday night. As futures sold off, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 all hit the so-called limit down threshold at one point, off by more than 5%, before paring those losses slightly.\nOn Wednesday, the Dow ended its historic 11-year bull market run by closing in bear-market territory. A bear market marks a 20% decline from all-time highs. - Stevens\n- CNBC's Michael Bloom, Thomas Franck, Kevin Stankiewicz, Nate Rattner, Jesse Pound, John Melloy and Yun Li contributed reporting. \nSubscribe to CNBC PRO for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from around the world."

    "content": "Stocks closed lower on Monday with the Nasdaq Composite index falling to the lowest level in two years as tech shares continue to be the hardest hit in this bear market because of spiking interest rates.\nThe Nasdaq Composite closed 1.04% lower at 10,542.10, hitting its lowest close since July 2020, weighed down by a slump in semiconductor stocks such as Nvidia and AMD. The S&P 500 also fell 0.75% to 3,612.39, dragged down by semi stocks and dips in major tech names like Microsoft, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 93.91 points, or 0.32%, to close at 29,202.88.\nThe declines came as JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned that the U.S. would likely fall into a recession in 2023, and that it may not be just a mild economic contraction as some economists have projected.\nA policy change weighed on semiconductor stocks after the Biden administration announced new export controls that limit U.S. companies selling advanced computing semiconductors and related manufacturing equipment to China. Tech shares have also been hit the hardest in this sell-off as rising rates expose their relatively high valuations and raise their cost of capital.\nWhile the bond market was closed, futures on the 10-year Treasury note were lower in Monday trading indicating yields will continue their march higher on Tuesday. Yields move inversely to prices. The price of 10-year Treasury futures were lower by about 0.6%. Trading volume was also lower than usual on Monday due to the Columbus Day Holiday.\n\"There are a lot of market participants that really key off of what the Treasury yields are doing, and when they're not open it's hard to have that volume in the market,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial. \"We're probably going to be in wait and see mode until we open in full force tomorrow.\"\nInvestors were also cautious ahead of key earnings and inflation reports this week that will shed new light on the U.S. economy. Four of the world's largest banks – JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Citi – report Friday. PepsiCo, Delta and Domino's are also among companies reporting next week.\nSeptember Producer Price Index data comes Wednesday and Consumer Price report is scheduled for Thursday.\nThe Nasdaq's losses for the year are now greater than 32% after Monday's decline. The S&P 500 is off by more than 24% in 2022.\nIn light of Q3 earnings that are expected to show their slowest growth of this year and the weakest since 2020, UBS has identified both stocks with upside potential and those with downside risk.\n\"Margin gains in '23 [are] at odds with fading sales growth expectations,\" UBS equity strategist Keith Parker said in a note Monday.\nStocks with earnings upside include Tempur Sealy Intl., Kellogg, Danaher, Corteva and Sonoco Products.\nThose companies with downside risk were named by UBS as Ross Stores, Weber, RealReal, Simply Good Foods and DocuSign.\n— Tanaya Macheel \nThe Dow is trying to squeak out a positive session on Monday, but struggles for some growth-focused ETFs show that investors are not exactly piling back into risk.\nCathie Wood's Flagship Ark Innovation ETF is down 2.7% on the day, and the Invesco Solar ETF has shed 1%. \nTwo smaller thematic funds that are struggling are the iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF and the Roundhill Sports Betting and Gaming ETF, which are both down more than 2%. \n— Jesse Pound\nStocks traded lower in the final hour of trading Monday after whiplashing during the day. The S&P 500 shed 0.71%, off lows of the day where it came within four points of its 52-week low. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 52 points, while the Nasdaq slipped 0.86%. \nEarlier in the day, the Nasdaq hit its lowest level in two years. \n—Carmen Reinicke\nThe S&P 500 came within four points of its 52-week low during Monday's volatile trading session, weighed down by falling semiconductor and technology stocks. \nAt lows of the day, the S&P 500 fell to 3,588.10. The indexes current 52-week low is the 3,584.13 level it hit on Sept. 30. \n\n—Carmen Reinicke\nMarkets are gearing up for a major week of inflation data that could move bonds and stocks for the rest of the week after a low-volume Monday. \nOn Tuesday, the New York Fed survey of consumer expectations, including what they think of inflation, comes out. On Wednesday and Thursday, the producer and consumer price indexes will be released. Then, on Friday, Consumer sentiment is released. \n\"Bond markets are closed today but I have a feeling they're going to be busy digesting all of the inflation data that's coming out,\" said Shawn Cruz, Head Trading Strategist at TD Ameritrade. He added that inflation data has driven much of the market's choppiness lately, as it will depend how aggressive the Federal Reserve is with continued rate hikes going forward. \n-- Carmen Reinicke \nFed Vice Chair Lael Brainard said at an event in Chicago that the central bank was seeing \"tentative\" signs of a cooling labor market and acknowledged that \"lags in transmission\" mean that the Fed's recent rate hikes will have a growing impact on non-housing sectors of the economy in the coming months. \nBrainard also said the Fed was aware of the impact of hikes on the global economy, and not just in the U.S.\n\"The combined effect of concurrent global tightening is larger than the sum of its parts. The Federal Reserve takes into account the spillovers of higher interest rates, a stronger dollar, and weaker demand from foreign economies into the United States, as well as in the reverse direction. We are attentive to the risk of further adverse shocks—for instance, from Russia's war against Ukraine, the pandemic, or China's zero-COVID policies,\" Brainard said.\nBrainard did not reveal her preference for the size of rate hikes going forward nor suggest that the Fed pause its tightening process, but stocks appeared to rebound slightly after the comments were released.\nBrainard also pointed to high profit margins in some sectors, such as auto dealerships, as proof that rate hikes have not yet had their desired impact. \n\"Monetary policy will be restrictive for some time to ensure that inflation moves back to target over time. It will take time for the cumulative effect of tighter monetary policy to work through the economy broadly and to bring inflation down,\" she said. \n—Jesse Pound\nPharmaceutical companies Immunic and scPharmaceuticals were moving with unusually heavy volumes during day trading Monday.\nImmunic shares shot up 49.5% following news of a securities purchase agreement with a 10% upside to Friday's closing price. The company focuses on the treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.\n\nscPharmaceuticals plunged 21.7% after the company announced it entered into a $100 million debt financing agreement with Oaktree Capital Management. The company also announced Monday it received Food and Drug Administration approval for FUROSCIX, which treats congestion due to fluid overload in adults with certain types of chronic heart failiure.\n\n— Alex Harring\nThe Bank of England's efforts to exit its ultra-easy monetary policy reverberated through bond markets Monday, sending UK yields higher and leading traders to up their best on rates in the U.S.\nAn announcement from the BofE indicated that the central bank will implement measures to achieve an \"orderly end\" to its scheduled termination Friday of its quantitative easing program. The bank said it will launch multiple liquidity facilities to make sure markets continue to function properly amid the QE exit.\nYields on 10-year gilts jumped nearly 23 basis points to 4.455% by 1 p.m. New York Time. Other areas across the yield curve moved even higher. German 10-year bund yields jumped in kind, moving to 2.34% after earlier hitting the highest levels since November 2011.\nAt the same time, the fed futures contracts priced in higher rates in the U.S. The April 2023 contract implied a rate of 4.715%, well above the current range of 3%-3.25% and the Fed's unofficial forecast terminal rate of 4.6%. \nThe BoE's move was seen parts of the market as a gamble to restore its credibility following weeks of volatility.\n\"Whether the government succeeds or fails in shoring up fiscal credibility will define the trade-off facing the Bank,\" Krishna Guha, head of central bank strategy for Evercore ISI, said in a note. \"If it fails, the market rate curve will move up further, and the Bank will face a near-impossible trade-off between validating these expectations and crushing the economy and housing market, or trying to deliver less than the market expects, and crashing sterling and risking inflation expectations.\"\nThe U.S. bond market was closed Monday for the Columbus Day holiday.\n—Jeff Cox\n Instead of a light at the end of the tunnel, markets are barreling towards an earnings recession train that the Federal Reserve can't stop, Morgan Stanley chief equity strategist Michael Wilson wrote in a Friday note.\n\"Fire and Ice remains in gear with M2 growth now into the danger zone where financial/economic stress occurs,\" Wilson wrote, adding \"while the Fed can fix this by restarting QE, it cannot stop the oncoming earnings recession.\"\nMorgan Stanley remains bearish and sellers of rallies until the price is right, and sees many macro risks including weakness in Europe, dollar strength, higher rates, China's reopening in focus in corporate commentary in earnings.\nThe firm also sees that bear market conditions have not been met, so it's too soon to call the end of the cycle.\n—Carmen Reinicke\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said Monday that the U.S. economy is likely to fall into recession during the spring or summer of 2023.\nDimon told CNBC's Julianna Tatelbaum that persistent inflation, rising interest rates and the ongoing war in Ukraine were all factors hurting economies of Europe and the U.S.\n\"These are very, very serious things which I think are likely to push the U.S. and the world — I mean, Europe is already in recession — and they're likely to put the U.S. in some kind of recession six to nine months from now,\" Dimon said.\nDimon said that there is uncertainty about how bad a recession will be and is not predicting just a mild dip that some bullish investors are looking for.\n\"It can go from very mild to quite hard and a lot will be reliant on what happens with this war. So, I think to guess is hard, be prepared,\" he said.\n— Jesse Pound\nThese companies are making headlines midday:\nCheck out more midday movers here.\n— Tanaya Macheel\nStocks slumped Monday and were in the red at midday trading, though off the lows of the day. \nThe Nasdaq Composite fell more than 1% to a new low Monday, but regained some of those losses to trade down about 0.94% at noon in New York. The S&P 500 shed 0.56% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 48 points, or 0.16%.\n-- Carmen Reinicke\nIn the upcoming earnings season, the kind of guidance that companies give about what they expect in the future is more important than what they report for the third quarter, according to Bank of America equity strategist Savita Subramanian.\n\"S&P 500 3Q EPS estimates have fallen 7% since July, more than the typical 4% cut into earnings,\" Subramanian wrote in Sunday note. \"Nine of the 11 sectors saw downward revisions to earnings, where Energy was the only sector with meaningful upward revisions.\"\nWhile overall economic data have help up in the third quarter, many indicators that Bank of America tracks suggest that a miss is likely for earnings.\n\"Our 3Q forecast of $50 (+2% YoY) is 1% below consensus' $55.58 (+3% YoY),\" Subramanian wrote. \"But guidance is likely to matter most, and we see substantial downside risk to 4Q and 2023.\"\nIn addition, the bank's corporate misery is high given increased margin pressure, hits to demand and bloated inventories.\nThey'll be watching for signs of further economic weakness going forward.\n\"Recession is top of mind for investors, and consumer weakness was evident during 2Q earnings,\" wrote Subramanian. \"Mentions of weak demand and layoffs will be closely watched. We calculate FX was a 3ppt hit to 3Q sales growth from translation, the biggest headwind since 2015.\n—Carmen Reinicke\nThe Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 both fell to their lowest levels since September 2020 on Monday. Each index is now down more than 32% for the year. \nSemiconductor stocks are one of the main sources of weakness on Monday, with Lam Research down more than 8% and Marvell off by 7%. \nChinese internet stock Pinduoduo is the worst performer in the Nasdaq 100, falling more than 11%.\n— Jesse Pound, Gina Francolla\nFamed investor Paul Tudor Jones believes the U.S. economy could already be in a recession amid the Fed's aggressive tightening cycle. \nThe founder and chief investment officer of Tudor Investment said there is a specific recession playbook to follow for investors navigating the treacherous waters, and history shows that risk assets have more room to fall before hitting a bottom.\n\"Most recessions last about 300 days from the commencement of it,\" Jones said. \"The stock market is down, say, 10%. The first thing that will happen is short rates will stop going up and start going down before the stock market actually bottoms.\"\n— Yun Li\nAfter remote school and work during the Covid pandemic created a surge in demand for iPads, Apple is likely to see year over year declines in iPad shipments for 2022 and 2023, according to Bank of America.\nAnalyst Wamsi Mohan said in a note to clients on Monday that iPad sales could fall to pre-pandemic levels next year. \n\"Although the device continues to attract a high proportion of new users (~50% of purchasers in any qtr. even pre-pandemic were new to the device), replacement rates remain muted. We see this as a function of the category being in structural decline,\" the note said. \nOn the bright side, Apple could see a rebound in 2024 as iPads purchased early in the pandemic are due for an upgrade, Mohan said. \nShares of Apple were down 0.7% in morning trading. Bank of America has a neutral rating on the tech stock. \n— Jesse Pound\nA selloff in semiconductor stocks brought two key industry exchange-traded funds to their lowest levels in 52 weeks on Monday. \nThe slump comes amid a shift in U.S. policy that limits companies from exporting to China. \nBoth the iShares Semiconductor ETF and the Vaneck Semiconductor ETF fell to their lowest levels since November 2020. Shares of LAM Research, Marvell, KLA and AMAT all down over -4% so far today, dragging the ETFs lower. \n-- Carmen Reinicke, Gina Francolla \nDecember wheat futures rallied 4.6% Monday morning to a high of $9.245 a bushel (60 pounds of wheat) after Russian missile attacks struck more than 10 cities in Ukraine overnight, raising concern that exports will be hurt.\nThe Teucrium Wheat Fund is ahead 3.3% premarket while the Invesco DB Agriculture Fund is higher by 1.3%.\nDecember gold and silver contracts were trading at one-week lows, with the VanEck Gold Miners ETF Gold ETF and Global X Silver Miners ETF down between 1.3% and 1.8% in early trading. First Majestic Silver, Harmony Gold and Hecla Mining fell about 2%.\nThe dollar index is on pace for a fourth straight advance, with the euro falling as low as 0.968 against the dollar.\n— Scott Schnipper, Gina Francolla\nThe strength of the U.S. dollar is likely to be an important point coming up in earnings, according to Chris Larkin, managing director of trading at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. \n\"The last earnings season of the year is kicking off following a week where—in typical 2022 trading fashion—there was no shortage of eyebrow-raising price moves,\" Larkin wrote in a Monday note. \"Despite pulling back to a two-week low last Tuesday, the US dollar index bounced to end last week up more than 17% for the year, and not too far below its 20-year high.\" \n\"We may hear more in the coming weeks on the pressures an exceptionally strong dollar can have on US exports and thus, earnings of US companies, but dollar strength could also play a role in getting the Fed to \"back off\" from its tightening policy,\" he added. \"Though even if continued dollar strength eventually contributes to the Fed switching from raising rates to cutting them, the timing of such a pivot remains uncertain, and might not change the downward trajectory of corporate earnings.\"\n—Carmen Reinicke\nCNBC Pro subscribers can get the lowdown on the biggest calls of the day coming out of Wall Street.\nCalls from Monday and over the weekend that investors are taking note of include:\nRead the highlights here.\n— Alex Harring\nUsed vehicle prices, a key driver of inflation over the past year or so, could be showing signs of letting up.\nPrices in September dropped 0.1% from a year ago, according to the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index. That's the first negative 12-month reading for the index since May 2020 and indication that a sector that had been heavily impacted by pandemic-related spending could be seeing some relief.\nIn the summer of 2021, for instance, used vehicle prices had been rising at a pace of more than 10% a month. A dearth of new vehicles had pushed buyers into the used market, sending prices skyrocketing.\nHowever, in recent months, prices have receded. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, for instance, reported a 0.1% month-over-month decline in August.\nMarkets will get a look at fresh inflation figures Thursday when the BLS releases September's consumer price index. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect headline CPI to show a 0.3% monthly increase and an 8.1% annual gain.\n—Jeff Cox\n \nThe Federal Reserve is probably not anywhere near a pivot from raising interest rates to cutting them, according to Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser of Allianz. \n\"Can they stop, can they pivot? No they cannot,\" El-Erian said on CNBC's Squawk Box Monday morning. \"They cannot because the data does not give them enough of a green light, but importantly their credibility has been hit very hard.\" \nHe added that because of this, it's likely that the Fed will overtighten and lead to a U.S. recession.\n\"They've gotten themselves into this hole and unfortunately they don't know how to get out of this hole,\" he said. \"There's no ladder out of this hole.\" \n—Carmen Reinicke\nMonday could see light volume with many Wall Street traders off for Columbus Day. The U.S. stock market is open Monday, but the bond market is closed. \nOn last year's Columbus Day, the SPDR S&P 500 Trust traded about 65 million times. That is lower than any day in September or October of this year. \nWhile lower volume can sometimes make for a sleepy trading day, it could also contribute to outsized stock moves, as the market could be more susceptible to news events that drive knee-jerk reactions. \n— Jesse Pound\nRivian Automotive shares dropped nearly 10% in premarket trading after the EV startup said it will recall nearly all of its vehicles due to a possible issue of a loose fastener that could make a driver lose steering control.\nIn May, Rivian recalled electric pickup trucks in the United States because airbags may not deactivate when a child is in the front passenger seat. The stock has lost 67% this year as rising rates hit growth names particularly hard. \n— Yun Li\nMultiple large explosions hit Ukraine's capital Kyiv on Monday, killing and injuring people, the city's emergency services said. The attacks come just days after a blast destroyed part of Russia's Kerch Bridge, the only bridge that links Russia to the Crimean peninsula. Moscow illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. \nRussian President Vladimir Putin called the blast at the Kerch Bridge a \"terrorist attack.\" Kyiv has not directly taken responsibility for the explosion. \nThe strikes are the latest escalation of conflict between Russia and Ukraine. \nRead more on CNBC's live blog of the situation. \n—Carmen Reinicke\nThe Bank of England is set to introduce further liquidity measures as it seeks to ensure financial stability in the U.K.\nIt comes after the central bank on Sep. 28 announced a two-week emergency two-week purchase program for long-dated U.K. government bonds. It was designed to protect liability driven investment (LDI) funds from imminent collapse.\nNow, the BOE has announced further measures to ensure an \"orderly end\" to its purchase scheme on Oct. 14, including increasing the size of its daily auctions to allow headroom for gilt purchases ahead of Friday's deadline.\nRead more here.\n\n— Elliot Smith\nEuropean markets retreated on Monday morning, tracking negative global sentiment as investors bet that last week's U.S. jobs data will keep the Federal Reserve on an aggressive path of interest rate hikes.\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 fell 0.4% in early trade, with utilities shedding 1.2% to lead losses as most sectors and major bourses slid into the red.\n- Elliot Smith\nAs Europe struggles with soaring electricity and gas bills, Goldman Sachs says global companies focussing on energy efficiency are set to outperform. \n\"We think Energy Efficiency companies can outperform over the short term, with the focus on energy efficiency to tackle the current energy crisis that followed the Russian invasion of Ukraine,\" the analysts wrote in a note on Oct. 3. \n\"[And] over the long term, with the focus on energy efficiency to tackle the climate change and reach the ambitious 'net zero' targets.\"\nCNBC Pro subscribers can read more here.\n— Weizhen Tan\nThe Caixin services purchasing managers' index came in at 49.3 in September, according to a report published Saturday, a steep drop from 55 in August.\nThe 50-point mark separates growth from contraction. PMI readings compare activity from month to month.\nThe nation's Covid curbs caused services activity in China to contract in September for the first time since May, the report said.\n\"Companies that reported reduced activity frequently commented that the pandemic and subsequent measures to contain the virus had restricted operations and weighed on demand in September,\" the press release by Caixin said.\n— Abigail Ng\nAllianz Chief Economic Adviser Mohamed El-Erian predicts core inflation will continue rising while headline inflation comes down to about 8%.\nHe told CBS' \"Face The Nation\" on Sunday that inflation core inflation will eventually come down. But he expects new Consumer Price Index data coming Thursday to show it rose again month over month.\nCore inflation previously rose 0.6% from July to August – the most recent data before what is coming next week – and was up 6.3% from a year ago.\n\"The question is, does it come down with a slowdown in the economy or a major recession?\" he said.\n— Alex Harring, Ashley Capoot\nMarket observers will be watching for key data and information coming in the coming week.\nFour of the world's largest banks, as well as consumer interest brands like PepsiCo and Domino's, will report earnings for a week many call the start to the new earnings season.\nThey will also watch for Consumer Price Index data Thursday morning as concerns over inflation continue to impact the political landscape and economic policy.\nNew data from the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index will drop Friday morning. This index gauges consumer feelings about issues such as the health of the business world and their finances and is considered a key indicator of how average Americans feel about the economy.\nCNBC Pro subscribers can see more to watch for here.\n— Alex Harring, Jesse Pound\nStock futures were down at the start of after-hours trading Sunday night.\nFutures connected to the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.3% to 29,225 points.\nBoth the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 saw futures down 0.4% to 3,638 points and 11,056.75 points, respectively.\n— Alex Harring"

It later said it would temporarily shut down production at its South Carolina factory where it makes wide-body 787 jetliners, a move that effectively suspended Boeing's commercial aircraft assembly.\nBoeing's CEO Dave Calhoun, in a note to staff, cheered the progress airlines made toward getting billions in government aid to help soften the blow from the coronavirus, which has sent U.S. air travel demand down 95% from a year ago. —Leslie Josephs\nOn March 19, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a statewide shelter-in-place order to stem the spread of the Covid-19 coronavirus. Washington State Gov. Jay Inslee followed four days later.\nWhile they were moving aggressively relative to the rest of the country, the top employers in their states were weeks ahead of them.\nTwitter was the first to move, strongly encouraging its nearly 5,000 employees to work from home on March 1, because of the rapidly spreading coronavirus, and making the order mandatory on March 11. Amazon told its roughly 50,000 Seattle-area employees on March 4 to work from home if they could. Facebook informed its Bay Area workers the next day that it was \"strongly recommending\" they work remotely. Over the next week, Google, Microsoft and Salesforce mostly emptied out, keeping about 200,000 people away from the office.\nTech has taken a beating in recent years as critics have attacked the industry's growing power, privacy abuses and executive malfeasance. But the industry's early social-distancing moves are a big reason that California and Washington, two early U.S. hotspots of virus outbreak, have bent the infection curve while other states are deep in crisis. —Ari Levy\nThe ETF that tracks the S&P 500 rallied in after-hours trading after a report said a Gilead Sciences drug was showing effectiveness in treating the coronavirus.

But the new guidance nevertheless ramps up pressure on governors to loosen their restrictions, even as health experts and business leaders alike warn that widespread testing systems are needed before Americans can safely start returning to their normal lives.\n\"You're going to call your own shots,\" Trump said on a call with dozens governors Thursday afternoon, NBC News reported, citing two people listening on the call.\nDespite the president saying earlier this week that he believed some states may be able to \"reopen\" their economies before May, the White House guidelines do not offer any specific dates, a White House official told NBC. —Kayla Tausche, Kevin Breuninger\nPhiladelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker expressed optimism Thursday that many of the 22 million jobs lost so far during the coronavirus lockdown will come back, though he said the nation shouldn't rush.\nInstead, he counseled a slow return to normalcy, with parts of the economy that can practice social distancing to reopen first and others to come back online as medical advances make it possible.\n\"We're going to hit a period where it's going to be pretty bad. It's pretty bad right now,\" Harkin said during an interview on CNBC's \"Closing Bell.\" \"We will climb out of this. It's not going to be a sudden bounceback. I mean, it just doesn't make sense to me. There's going to be certain industries like travel and tourism and hospitality and so forth that will take some time to recovery.\"\nOne industry he cited specifically was construction. Pennsylvania's construction employment was at 266,000 in February and had been showing the state's biggest growth among all occupations prior to the coronavirus construction. \nSince then, the U.S. has record-breaking numbers of workers head to the unemployment line, with 5.2 million more filing over the past week. —Jeff Cox\nThe coronavirus pandemic has ravaged workers in Michigan and Pennsylvania, two of the states President Donald Trump most needs to win to earn another term in the White House. \nMore than 22 million Americans applied for unemployment insurance over the latest four weeks as the outbreak forced businesses to close, according to Labor Department data released Thursday. The two 2020 election battlegrounds took a bigger hit than nearly all other states. \nMichigan, with just above 1 million initial jobless claims during the period, saw the second highest number per capita. Pennsylvania had 1.3 million unemployment insurance claims overall, the fourth-most per 10,000 residents. \nGenerally, states that supported Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 saw more jobless claims than those that backed Trump. Michigan and Pennsylvania, which helped to send Trump to the White House by voting for him by razor thin margins, stand out from the bunch. —Jacob Pramuk, John Schoen\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a statewide executive order giving two weeks of supplemental paid sick leave for those working in the food sector.\"That sector by definition is essential to our livelihood and our capacity to meet just basic needs in this pandemic,\" Newsom said at a press briefing Thursday.The paid sick leave will be available to to workers who have contracted Covid-19, been exposed to it or have been affected by isolation or quarantine orders from local, state or federal health officials.\"We don't want you going to work if you're sick,\" Newsom said. The measure impacts frontline food workers such as those who grow, pick, pack, deliver, cook and sell food, according to Newsom.

Phil Murphy said he was \"outraged\" that staff at the Andover Subacute and Rehabilitation Center in Northern New Jersey piled deceased residents into a small room at the facility.\n\"A story like this shakes you to the bone,\" Gov. Phil Murphy said at a press conference. \"New Jerseans living in our long-term care facilities deserve to be cared for with respect, compassion and dignity. We can and must do better.\" \nState and local officials inspected the facility at about 2 a.m. on Sunday after receiving a call that it needed body bags and was storing 28 dead bodies, New Jersey Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli told reporters. There were just five bodies on the premises; three more were released to local mortuaries earlier, she said. They received another complaint on Tuesday, she said.\nOfficials have since discovered that 103 residents have tested positive for the coronavirus and 133 more have flu-like symptoms between the facility's two buildings, she said. At least 35 residents have died since March 30; 19 of those have been attributed to Covid-19, she said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said tests it sent out early on were found to be defective. \nBolten said returning to a more normal economic environment should involve a \"phased\" plan in which some businesses open before others and that policymakers should be working on those arrangements now.\n\"It's not too soon to plan for a safe and rapid reopening. In fact, it's very important that the planning go on now,\" Bolten said. —Jesse Pound\nAs the United States reels from the massive economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak, there are growing calls by President Donald Trump and others to start to reopen businesses, schools and other public spaces so that the nation can begin to recover financially.\nBut health experts and several top business leaders warn that the country should not reopen on a broad scale unless there is a huge increase in the relatively small number of tests currently being done for Covid-19 infection. Health experts also say the country needs a related and equally robust program to trace the people who have had contact with infected people, to avoid seeing those contacts themselves spread the coronavirus to others.\nThere are only about 120,000 samples or so being tested each day for the coronavirus in the United States, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nExperts say that millions of people will have to be tested each day, even as many as 20 million to 30 million people, before the nation can return to a semblance of economic normality. —Dan Mangan\nGeneral Electric and Ford Motor will produce 50,000 ventilators for the U.S. government under the Defense Production Act for $336 million, federal officials announced.\nProduction of the ventilators is expected to begin next week at a Ford facility in Michigan. The companies are expected to produce all the ventilators by July 13, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.\nAccording to the terms in the announcement, each ventilator would cost $6,720.

While still significantly down, sales through the first 12 days of April were only off by about 55% — indicating that sales for the full month might not be as bad as feared, the firm said Wednesday.\nIf that trend continues, it would mean sales of about 597,000 units in April compared with J.D. Power's prepandemic forecast of nearly 1.1 million vehicles for the month. —Michael Wayland \nStocks opened higher even as investors digested more data reflecting the economic devastation from the coronavirus pandemic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 44 points higher, or 0.2%. The S&P 500 climbed 0.7% while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.1%. \nThursday's moves followed a slump during regular trading on Wednesday as gloomy economic data and anemic bank earnings fueled concerns over the coronavirus's impact on the U.S. economy. —Fred Imbert, Thomas Franck \nThe coronavirus and the forced closure of business throughout the U.S. have nearly wiped out the totality of job gains since the Great Recession.\nThe Labor Department reported Thursday that the number of Americans applying for state unemployment benefits totaled 5.245 million during the week ended April 11. \nCombined with the government's prior three jobless claims reports, the number of Americans who have filed for unemployment over the previous four weeks is 22.025 million. That number is just below the 22.442 million jobs added to nonfarm payrolls since November 2009, when the U.S. economy first began to add jobs back to the economy after the recession. —Thomas Franck \nBillionaire businessman Barry Diller told CNBC on Thursday the U.S. government should bail out all companies that have been hit hard by the coronavirus, including those in the travel industry. \n\"The damage that is being done every day is enormous,\" Diller said on \"Squawk Box.\" \"Everybody needs to be bailed out for this one time thing, and we'll worry about paying the bills later.\"\nThe comments from Diller, chairman of travel site Expedia and digital media group IAC, came after major U.S. airlines and the Treasury Department reached a deal that gives the carriers access to loans and grants to support payroll. In return, the government gets warrants that could become equity stakes. \nDiller said Expedia is generating no revenue and will need to cut costs, including in advertising. —Jesse Pound \nStarbucks is preparing to reopen cafes as some U.S. states report that the number of new coronavirus cases has plateaued or even declined. \nThe coffee chain closed most of its U.S. and Canadian cafes on March 21, limiting service to delivery and drive-thru only. More than 60% of its U.S. cafes have a drive-thru lane. Starbucks initially said the closures would be for two weeks but later extended the measures until May 3. —Amelia Lucas\nU.S. homebuilding activity collapsed in March as the coronavirus spread, with housing starts tumbling 22.3% from a month ago.\nThe Commerce Department said Thursday that groundbreakings occurred last month at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.2 million units, down from a 1.56 million pace in February. Construction of single-family houses fell 17.5%, while apartment and condo starts were off 32.1% from a month ago.\nThe report showed a 6.1% decline in the completion of homes being constructed, which means many homes are being left half built. There was also a 6.8% drop in permits to begin construction. —Associated Press \nThe U.K. will most likely fail to strike a new trade agreement with the European Union by the end of the year, analysts have told CNBC, as the coronavirus crisis threatens to derail official trade talks.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to conclude a post-Brexit trade deal this year. The U.K. is in a transition phase until December after leaving the bloc on Jan. 31. During the transition, it is working to establish trade arrangements with the 27-nation EU.\nHowever, this timeline is now at risk after the two lead negotiators had to isolate due to Covid-19 infections. British and European negotiating teams held a call on Wednesday for the first time since both lead negotiators were forced to self-isolate. —Silvia Amaro \nBlackRock co-founder and CEO Larry Fink said the U.S. needs to increase its testing capacity for the coronavirus before its economy can restart in earnest. \n\"We're going to still see elements of the disease increasing in other parts of the world and until we have adequate testing, rapid testing, it's very hard to see how we're going to reboot in the next 30 days,\" Fink said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\nFink expressed confidence that the U.S. will make progress on Covid-19 treatments, minimizing the severity of the disease. \"Through that process, I do believe we'll be able to reboot. I do believe we're going to have a better, more normalized environment,\" he said. \n\"But it may not be in June or July. It may be in August,\" he said.\nFink, whose firm is the world's biggest asset manager, said businesses will be \"very cautious\" and \"protective of their employees\" as they consider when and how to relax work-from-home policies. —Kevin Stankiewicz \nProtection measures against the coronavirus continued to tear through the employment ranks, with 5.245 million more Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment insurance last week, the Labor Department reported Thursday.\nThe new filings bring the crisis total to just over 22 million, nearly wiping out all the job gains since the Great Recession.\nThough the most recent total, for the week ended April 11, represented a drop from the previous two weeks, it still showed that the damage to the U.S. labor market remains profound.\nThe numbers of late have been bolstered by measures taken to allow more workers to file claims. They now include independent contractors and others who previously were not eligible for benefits. —Jeff Cox\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos said Thursday that mass testing around the world for the coronavirus is needed to \"get the economy back up and running.\"\nIn his annual shareholder letter, Bezos also pointed to efforts Amazon has taken to protect its employees from the pandemic.\nBezos pointed to Amazon's efforts to develop \"incremental testing capacity,\" which the company announced last week. As part of that announcement, Amazon said it hopes to begin testing all of its employees, including those who show no symptoms.\n\"Regular testing on a global scale, across all industries, would both help keep people safe and help get the economy back up and running,\" Bezos said. \"For this to work, we as a society would need vastly more testing capacity than is currently available.\" —Annie Palmer\nPresident Donald Trump said he plans to release on Thursday national guidelines for reopening the economy. \n\"We'll be opening up some states much sooner than others,\" he said Wednesday. \"We think some of the states can actually open up before the deadline of May 1.\"\nThe governors of seven states on the East Coast and three states on the West Coast have announced regional working groups to coordinate the reopening of the regions. With the exception of Massachusetts, all 10 states actively developing plans to reopen are led by Democratic governors. —Will Feuer\nThree Chinese companies have vaccine candidates in clinical trials, CNBC's Eunice Yoon reports from Beijing. One company, Nasdaq-listed Sinovac, has already started enlisting volunteers to receive the first experimental doses. The company aims to complete safety and efficacy trials by June.\nThe Chinese government has allocated land for mass production of a successful vaccine candidate once it's ready, Yoon reports, and has expedited the approval process for human clinical trials. —Will Feuer\nDominic Raab, who is deputizing for Prime Minister Boris Johnson while he is recovering from a serious case of Covid-19, is meeting government ministers Thursday, and is chairing a meeting of its emergency response committee.\nIt's widely expected that the country's lockdown will be extended for three weeks, amid stark warnings that the U.K. could end up being the worst hit country from the coronavirus in Europe.\nThe U.K.'s top medical expert said Wednesday that the country is probably seeing its peak of the virus (the death toll currently stands at 12,868 in British hospitals, with 761 daily deaths reported Wednesday), but it is too early to consider lifting lockdown measures that have been in place since March 23. — Holly Ellyatt\nThe number of daily deaths in Spain has risen slightly, according to health ministry data.\nIn the past day, 551 people have died from the coronavirus, bringing the total death toll to 19,130. The daily death toll on Wednesday was 523.\nThe overall number of infections now stands at 182,816, the ministry said, 5,183 more cases than yesterday. —Holly Ellyatt\nThe World Health Organization's European regional director said that in the past 10 days, the number of confirmed cases in Europe has doubled to reach almost 1 million.\nWHO's Hans Kluge told reporters in an online briefing that this meant about 50% of the global burden of Covid-19 was in Europe, where he said more than 84,000 have died from the virus.\n\"The storm clouds of this pandemic still hang heavily over the European region,\" Kluge said, according to Reuters. Commenting on the gradual lifting of restrictions on public life, Kluge said \"there is no fast track back to normal.\" —Holly Ellyatt\nA study of Dutch blood donors has found that around 3% have developed antibodies against Covid-19, health authorities said, Reuters reported. The findings give an indication of what percentage of the Dutch population may have already had the disease.\nThe head of the National Institute for Health disclosed the results during a debate with parliament.\n\"This study shows that about 3% of Dutch people have developed antibodies against the coronavirus,\" Jaap van Dissel said, the news agency reported. \"You can calculate from that, it's several hundred thousand people,\" in a country of 17 million. —Holly Ellyatt\nRead CNBC's coverage from CNBC's Asia-Pacific and Europe teams overnight here: WHO says coming weeks are 'critical' as Europe's cases near 1 million"

    "content": "The coverage on this live blog has ended — but for up-to-the-minute coverage on the coronavirus, visit the live blog from CNBC's Asia-Pacific team.\nThe data above was compiled by Johns Hopkins University. \nMiami Mayor Francis Suarez issued a stay-at-home order due to the coronavirus. Suarez announced the order in a tweet, in which he also shared that he had tested positive for COVID-19. Suarez said he will remain in quarantine. —Salvador Rodriguez\ntweet\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration says it is \"aggressively monitoring\" at-home tests that claim to diagnose the coronavirus after seeing a slew of start-ups market kits that can be self-administered. The agency noted that some of these tests are unauthorized, going so far as to describe them as \"fraudulent.\" Companies including Forward, EverlyWell and Carbon Health were offering at-home tests, but are now working with the F.D.A. to get clearance before sending them to homes, according to the Wall Street Journal. —Christina Farr\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, under quarantine since contact with a Brazilian official earlier this month, received a negative test result for COVID-19 and will return to work on Wednesday, White House Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere told Reuters. \nGrisham, one of President Donald Trump's top aides, had been with the president at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, on March 7 when Trump played host to a dinner with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and a Brazilian delegation. The Brazilian press aide later tested positive for the virus.\n\"Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, who has been quarantined since coming in contact with Brazilian officials almost two weeks ago and working from home, has received negative COVID-19 test results and will be back to work tomorrow,\" Deere said. —Salvador Rodriguez, Reuters\nCrises are often the ticket to higher approval ratings for politicians, and President Donald Trump, it appears, is no exception.\nDuring an election year, any bump could have significant ramifications.\nIn the latest Gallup poll, released Tuesday, Trump's approval rating hit 49%, matching his best performance in the poll.\nEarlier this month, Trump's approval rating was at 44%, according to Gallup. The 5-point boost comes amid the president's near-daily participation in coronavirus task force briefings and series of moves to combat the pandemic in the United States. —Yelena Dzhanova\nNike executives during a post-earnings conference call Tuesday offered some encouraging words for the retail industry. CEO John Donahoe said he has confidence that everyone will see the \"other side of this crisis in the near future.\"\nNike said it is starting to see a \"recovery\" in China, where the virus originated.\nThe company said that at a peak in February, roughly 75% of Nike stores in Greater China were closed, with others open on reduced hours. As of Tuesday, however, nearly 80% of its stores in Greater China are open, Nike said. And it added that digital sales in China are approaching triple-digit growth.\nDonahoe said Nike will use this \"playbook\" from China to get other regions, like the U.S., back up and running again. — Lauren Thomas\nIn market terms, think of the coronavirus sell-off as a three-legged stool where if one of the legs isn't firmly attached, the whole thing will tip over.\nThe first leg is monetary policy, and that comes in the form of rock-bottom interest rates and a slew of programs aimed at keeping the markets functioning properly and funneling money to businesses and individuals who need it. That is well in place thanks to the Federal Reserve over the course of the last two weeks.\nThe second is fiscal policy, or the dollars that will be directed specifically to needy areas, the unemployed and businesses that have been displaced by the way the coronavirus has seized the national economy and brought key industries to a virtual standstill. There finally are signs that this leg soon will be nailed down.\nThe final, and most important, part of the stool, though, remains in the workshop. That's some kind of assurance that the virus has been contained, that the caseload and mortality rate at least plateaus and gives an indication that some sense of normalcy can be restored. —Jeff Cox\nMembers of the White House coronavirus task force urged those leaving New York City to self-quarantine for 14-days in order to stop the spread of COVID-19 during a press briefing on Tuesday. \nDeborah Birx, the task force coordinator, and Anthony Fauci, another task force member and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the precaution was necessary given the high rate of infections in the nation's most populous city. —Tucker Higgins\nStock futures rose in overnight trading, building on Tuesday's historic rally, as investors awaited an unprecedented stimulus package to combat the economic impact of the coronavirus.\nFutures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed about 130 points. The S&P 500 futures rose 11 points.\nThe action in the futures market followed an epic comeback on Wall Street. The Dow soared more than 2,100 points, or more than 11%, notching its biggest one-day percentage gain since 1933 and its best point increase ever. The S&P 500 rallied 9.4% for its best day since October 2008. —Yun Li\nDuring the past month's extreme market volatility, Amazon has been a relative safe haven.\nAnd that tells you everything you need to know about the company's critical role in society. \nEven with the economy almost certainly headed into recession and unemployment projected to spike, consumers are flocking to Amazon to buy essential health and household products while getting groceries delivered through services like Amazon Fresh. Last week, Amazon said that it's hiring an additional 100,000 full-time and part-time employees in the U.S. for warehouse and delivery jobs to meet the surge in demand from online shopping amid the coronavirus outbreak, and is increasing pay and offering more lenient sick leave policies to keep workers engaged. —Ari Levy\nUniversal Orlando Resort is extending its closure until April 19. After shutting down on March 16, the theme park originally planned to stay closed until the end of March. The Universal Orlando Resort Hotels have also temporarily suspended operations. \"We will continue to monitor the situation and make adjustments as needed, based on guidance from health agencies and government officials,\" the resort said in a statement. —Hannah Miller\nNew York City plans to release roughly 300 nonviolent inmates from Rikers Island, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday, after the city's first prisoner tested positive for the coronavirus last week.\nThe prisoners all have light sentences, less than a year, and were found guilty of misdemeanor charges, de Blasio said. The city has incarcerated more than 5,000 inmates housed mostly at Rikers with about 500 inmates serving sentences for nonviolent misdemeanor crimes, which de Blasio said he has the authority to release. —Noah Higgins-Dunn\nA child under 18 has died from the coronavirus in California, Los Angeles County health officials announced Tuesday.\n\"Tragically, one of the people who died was a person under the age of 18, a devastating reminder that COVID-19 infects people of all ages,\" Dr. Barbara Ferrer, director of the County of Los Angeles Public Health Department, said at a news briefing.\nThe patient was from Lancaster, California, the county's health department said in a press release. Ferrer did not provide more details such as the precise age of the patient or whether they had underlying health conditions. Representatives from the health department weren't immediately available for further comment. —Will Feuer\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved new emergency protocols Tuesday that will allow doctors to treat coronavirus patients with plasma donated by those who survived the virus, according to NBC News.\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Monday that the state's health department would begin using the plasma treatment on critically ill coronavirus patients.Known as convalescent plasma, the treatment is centuries-old and was used during the 1918 flu pandemic. It involves harvesting antibodies that fight viruses from the blood of those who were previously infected. The method was also used on some patients during the 2002 SARS outbreak.The FDA cautioned that convalescent plasma has not yet been proven effective for the coronavirus and that researchers should apply for permission before beginning a trial that uses it. —Hannah Miller\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average soared on Tuesday, logging in its best day in 87 years as investors hoped U.S. lawmakers were close to an agreement on a stimulus bill to rescue the economy from the damage caused by the coronavirus.\nThe 30-stock average closed 2,112.98 points higher — or more than 11% — at 20,704.91, notching its biggest one-day percentage gain since 1933. The S&P 500 rallied 9.4% to 2,447.33 for its best day since October 2008. The Nasdaq Composite surged 8.1% to 7,417.86, its best day since March 13. Both the Dow and S&P 500 were coming off their lowest levels since late 2016.—Fred Imbert, Thomas Franck\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that it's temporarily easing restrictions on veterinarians to allow them to more easily use telemedicine to treat pets during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"We need to provide veterinarians with the latitude to expand the use of telemedicine in the care of animals, not only pets but also the animals that produce our food,\" FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said in a statement.The FDA will suspend its rules requiring vets to physically examine pets, allowing them to prescribe drugs with a video examination. —Hannah Miller\nMicrosoft co-founder Bill Gates said Tuesday that the United States missed its chance to avoid mandated shutdowns because it didn't act fast enough on the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. \n\"The U.S. is past this opportunity to control (COVID-19) without shutdown,\" Gates said during a TED Connects program broadcast online. \"We did not act fast enough to have an ability to avoid the shutdown.\"\n\"It's January when everybody should've been on notice,\" Gates added. The virus was first discovered in December in China. —Jessica Bursztynsky\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said his state has seen an additional 17 deaths from the coronavirus, the largest death toll reported over a single day. The new numbers bring the state's total number of coronavirus-related deaths to 44. New Jersey also reported 846 new cases, bringing the state total to 3,675 confirmed cases. —Hannah Miller\nU.S. federal antitrust authorities announced they will expedite joint venture reviews for cases involving efforts to stop the spread of the new coronavirus.\nWhile such reviews can typically take months, the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice said in a joint statement they will aim to resolve reviews of ventures addressing public health and safety\" within seven days of getting necessary information. The agencies are acting under a statute meant to promote research and innovation.\nThe statement also highlighted the ways companies can collaborate during the crisis without fearing a violation of antitrust laws. —Lauren Feiner \nIn the U.S., the virus has infected more than 50,206 people as of 2:15 p.m. EDT and killed at least 600 people, according to Hopkins. New York state, which has 25,665 confirmed cases as of Tuesday, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo, accounts for nearly half of all cases in the U.S. \nConfirmed U.S. cases passed 5,000 just one week ago. On March 1, there were roughly 100 confirmed cases in the U.S. —Will Feuer\nThe U.S. has \"several more weeks\" to go before officials should consider lifting stringent coronavirus mitigation measures like stay-at-home orders, former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told CNBC. \n\"This is going to be a long fight,\" he said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" \"I think we need to keep this going for several more weeks, but there is an end to this and we know where it is.\" —Will Feuer\nPresident Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence held a call to discuss the coronavirus impact on the economy, according to people familiar with the call.\nInvestors on the call included Third Point's Dan Loeb, Blackstone's Stephen Schwarzman, Vista Equity's Robert Smith, Intercontinental Exchange's Jeffrey Sprecher and Paul Tudor Jones, hedge fund manager and co-founder of JUST Capital.\nThe call with some of Wall Street's top investors and hedge fund leaders was less focused on potential actions the administration could take to mitigate the impact of the novel coronavirus. Instead, it was more focused on how America's top money managers are viewing markets and the U.S. economy, the people familiar with the matter said. —Kayla Tausche, Thomas Franck\nCOVID-19 cases surpassed 400,000 worldwide, doubling in less than a week as the virus spreads more rapidly across the world.\nThe total number of cases now stands at 407,485 as of 1:30 p.m. EDT, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. The virus emerged in Wuhan, China in December. It has since spread to most countries around the world, according to the World Health Organization. —Will Feuer\nPresident Donald Trump said that he wants the U.S. economy to \"open\" back up by Easter Sunday, even as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country accelerates.\nEaster is April 12, less than three weeks away.\nTrump's remarks in a Fox News \"virtual town hall\" event at the White House came as more states imposed extreme measures, including shutting down businesses and ordering residents to stay home, to try to slow the spread of the disease.\n\"We're opening up this incredible country. Because we have to do that. I would love to have it open by Easter,\" Trump said. —Kevin Breuninger\nPresident Donald Trump asked South Korean President Moon Jae-in for medical equipment to help combat coronavirus during a phone call between the two leaders, according to a report published in a state-funded newspaper. \nMoon said that the country will provide \"maximum support\" if it is available, Yonhap News Agency reported.\nThe South Korean leader also told Trump that the support could require approval from the FDA, and Trump responded that he would seek the approval within the day, according to the outlet.  It was not immediately clear what type of medical equipment Trump was seeking. —Tucker Higgins\nThe death toll from an outbreak of coronavirus in Italy has grown by 743 to 6,820, the head of the Civil Protection Agency said, reversing a decline in fatalities seen over the last two days.\nOn Monday 602 people died. That followed 650 deaths on Sunday and 793 on Saturday -- the highest daily figure since the contagion came to light on Feb. 21.\nThe total number of confirmed cases in Italy rose to 69,176 from a previous 63,927, an increase of 8.2%, in line with Monday's growth rate, the Civil Protection Agency said. —Reuters\nCoca-Cola is feeling the strain of the coronavirus pandemic on its supply chain.\n\"The supply chain is creaking around the world. There are flash points when it's getting a little harder to get ingredients through, whether it's delays at the borders, the big changes in channel mix,\" CEO James Quincey said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\"\nIn the United States, the beverage giant is seeing heightened demand from grocery stores and e-commerce channels for its drinks as consumers stockpile food and beverages in preparation for spending more time at home. As a result, the company is focusing on producing the products most important to its business, such as water, soda and sports drinks. —Amelia Lucas\nThe U.K. government appealed for 250,000 \"people in good health\" to help its health service cope with the coronavirus outbreak.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock also said that final year medical students and student nurses would be moved to the National Health Service's (NHS) \"front line.\"\n\"We are seeking a quarter of a million volunteers, people in good health, to help the NHS, for shopping, for delivery of medicines and to support those who are shielded to protect their own health,\" Hancock told reporters. —Katrina Bishop, Ryan Browne\nNot even a month ago, thousands of borrowers were rushing to take advantage of record-low mortgage rates. Refinance applications soared over 400% annually, and homebuyers were out early and in force.\nBut now some of those loans are stuck in limbo as the in-person closing process can no longer be held.\nAcross the nation, state, county and local governments, including recording offices, have shut down or are at least limiting the number of people who may enter the office.\nThat puts the whole system at risk, as title insurers are less able to conduct the title research that goes into issuing a policy. The ability to record documents is also getting tougher as county recording offices close. —Diana Olick\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo pushed back hard against the idea raised by President Donald Trump of easing restrictions from coronavirus mitigation efforts in an effort to revive the U.S. economy.\n\"I understand what the president is saying that this is unsustainable that we close down the economy and we continue to spend money. There is no doubt about that,\" Cuomo said at a press conference in New York City.\n\"But if you ask the American people to choose between public health and the economy then it's no contest. No American is going to say 'accelerate the economy at the cost of human life,'\" Cuomo argued. —Dan Mangan\nMore businesses in Washington, D.C. are closing to help curb the coronavirus outbreak. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced that salons, barbershops and other services not related to emergency response will be shut down. The city previously closed schools, museums, libraries, fitness centers and other businesses. \nMore states are ordering residents to stay at home during the coronavirus crisis, as the COVID-19 outbreak worsens in the U.S. \nA total of 13 states so far have orders to stay at home, including California, New York, Washington State and Illinois. Three states have advisories or instructions from their governors to remain at home. Four states have either cities or counties with stay-at-home orders. —Hannah Miller\nBorrowers with federal student loans now have two options for relief if they suffer financial hardship from the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe Department of Education announced that all borrowers with federal loans will have their interest rates automatically set at 0% for at least 60 days, a measure first announced by President Donald Trump earlier this month. Now, borrowers with federal loans have the option to suspend payments completely for at least two months without accruing interest.\nWhile the interest rate reduction is automatic, borrowers need to request the suspension of payment, called a forbearance, from their loan servicers online or by phone. This can help free up cash for other bills or financial obligations during the coronavirus crisis. —Alicia Adamczyk\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the hardware supply chain is coming back online as the coronavirus outbreak eases up in Asia, but said that the big question would be whether demand holds up in the U.S. and Europe.\n\"On the supply side we are getting back on rails,\" Nadella told CNBC's Jon Fortt when asked about whether Microsoft would be able to deliver later this year certain products it had promised before COVID-19 took hold, like new Surface devices and a revamped Xbox gaming console.\n\"We have a great balance sheet, we are a very diverse business, we have a mix of annuity, non-annuity, that is also stronger than even the last time we even went into the financial crisis,\" he said. \"I feel confident we'll come out of this, frankly, pretty strong.\"\nHe said the company's cloud infrastructure and services have been holding up under increased demand. —Jordan Novet\nAs Republicans and Democrats forged ahead toward a deal on a massive economic stimulus proposal to combat the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, details of the developing proposal started to emerge. \nHere are some of the top components of the plan as it stood Tuesday morning, according to congressional leaders:\nSenate Democrats struck down the bill in a procedural vote on Monday amid a gulf in what both parties wanted to include in it. But they made progress by Tuesday morning, as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the sides were at \"the 2-yard line.\" —Jacob Pramuk, Yelena Dzhanova\nStarbucks CEO Kevin Johnson said that the coffee chain believes the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S. is following a comparable path to what happened in China. \n\"It may be that in the United States it's a little bit longer, a week or two longer period to see the recovery. It may be the same recovery, but right now it's tracking in a very similar way to China,\" Johnson said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\"\nJohnson said Starbucks built a model to follow the company's business recovery in China, where the coronavirus pandemic began in late December. \"It's now like week three here in the U.S. and we look back at what happened in China and we sort of know what to expect,\" Johnson said. —Kevin Stankiewicz\nMost of America's department stores are sitting dark. \nMacy's, J.C. Penney, Nordstrom and Kohl's have closed their shops across the U.S. temporarily, to try to help halt the spread of COVID-19. Many specialty shops found in the mall, such as American Eagle and Gap, have also closed up. Some mall owners, including the biggest in the U.S., Simon Property Group, have shut all of their properties for the time being. \nBut there is still at least one department store chain keeping its doors open: Dillard's.\nCNBC spoke to multiple employees, one of which said they were \"begging\" for the company to close. The workers all requested anonymity to protect their jobs. —Lauren Thomas\nStocks rebounded aggressively from a three-year low as investors hoped U.S. lawmakers were close to an agreement on a stimulus bill to rescue the economy from the damage caused by the coronavirus.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 1,600 points, or more than 8%. The S&P 500 gained 7.5% while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 6.6%. The Dow and S&P 500 closed at their lowest levels since late-2016 on Monday. —Fred Imbert, Thomas Franck\nPresident Donald Trump and his top economic aide Larry Kudlow suggested that a massive coronavirus stimulus bill could provide the foundation for an economic revival in the United States.\n\"Our people want to return to work,\" Trump tweeted. \"They will practice Social Distancing and all else, and Seniors will be watched over protectively & lovingly. We can do two things together.\"\nKudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, echoed Trump's remarks from a Monday evening press briefing that some states with low numbers of confirmed cases might be able to ease off their restrictions quickly. That relief could come soon after the White House's 15-day guidelines on social distancing expire next week, Kudlow said. —Kevin Breuninger\nFord announced it will partner with 3M and GE Healthcare to begin producing face masks and ventilators to help fill potential shortages caused by the coronavirus. \nFord will work with 3M to manufacture a newly designed respirator and boost production of 3M's powered air-purifying respirator, which uses a blower instead of lung power to draw air through the filter. Ford said unionized employees will be able to manufacture the new respirators. \nFord and GE Healthcare will begin manufacturing a \"simplified version of GE Healthcare's existing ventilator design\" to aid patients who may experience trouble breathing caused by COVID-19. —Noah Higgins-Dunn\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a \"total lockdown\" in the country of 1.3 billion people during a televised address, the most extensive stay-at-home order yet in the world's fight against the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe 21-day lockdown was set to begin at midnight.\n\"To save India and every Indian, there will be a total ban on venturing out of your homes,\" Modi said, adding that if the county failed to manage the next 21 days, it would be set back by 21 years. —Associated Press\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said a \"troubling and astronomical\" number of coronavirus cases have increased the urgency across the state for more hospital beds as the pace of new infections rises at a rapid clip. Cases soared across the state to 25,665, Cuomo said. \n\"We're not slowing it and it is accelerating on its own,\" Cuomo said at a press conference. He said the state is now projecting it will need more hospital beds and a lot sooner than previously thought. The state now estimates it will need 140,000 hospital beds, up from previous projections of 110,000. \"That apex could be, they project, 14 to 21 days away.\" —Wiliam Feuer, Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Noah Higgins-Dunn\nThe Trump administration plans to use the Defense Production Act for the first time during this coronavirus pandemic to procure thousands of COVID-19 test kits as the disease continues its spread across the country.\nPeter Gaynor, the Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator, told CNN that the administration had decided to use the Defense Production Act to acquire some 60,000 kits. The FEMA chief added that the White House will add \"DPA language\" into its mass contract for 500 million masks. —Thomas Franck\nThe number of coronavirus cases in Italy is probably 10 times higher than the official tally, the head of the agency collating the data said as the government readied new measures to force people to stay at home.\n\"A ratio of one certified case out of every 10 is credible,\" Angelo Borrelli, the head of the Civil Protection Agency, told La Repubblica newspaper, indicating he believed as many as 640,000 people could have been infected.\nItaly has seen more fatalities than any other country, with latest figures showing that 6,077 people have died from the infection in barely a month, while the number of confirmed cases has hit 64,000. However, testing for the disease has often been limited to people seeking hospital care, meaning that thousands of infections have certainly gone undetected. —Reuters\nNew Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham issued \"stay-at-home\" instructions late Monday, to take effect Tuesday. Residents should remain in their homes except for outings absolutely necessary for health, safety and welfare, Grisham said in a statement.\nNew Mexico Secretary of Health Kathy Kunkel also issued an order closing all non-essential businesses. The public health emergency order requires 100% of the state's non-essential workforce to work from home. It is in effect until April 10. Essential businesses that are allowed to remain open include health-care operations, homeless shelters and grocery stores. —Hannah Miller\nTwo of the largest private labs in the U.S. will collectively be able to process more than 300,000 COVID-19 tests by the end of the week, their CEOs say. LabCorp CEO Adam Schechter told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" the company is processing around 20,000 tests daily and will by the end of the week be able to \"a lot more\" than 100,000 tests per week. \nQuest Diagnostics is conducting about 25,000 COVID-19 tests per day, with plans of increasing daily capacity to around 30,000 by the end of the week, CEO Steve Rusckowski told CNBC's \"Closing Bell.\" That would put Quest's weekly capacity around 200,000, he said. —Kevin Stankiewicz\nStocks jumped on Tuesday as investors hoped U.S. lawmakers were close to an agreement on a stimulus bill to rescue the economy from the coronavirus.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average traded more than 1,300 points higher, or 7.1%. The S&P 500 gained 6.2% while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 5.7%. —Fred Imbert, Thomas Franck\nThe International Olympic Committee postponed the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games, officials announced Tuesday. The event was scheduled to start July 24 in Tokyo.\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he and the head of the IOC agreed to delay the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo for about a year. The games will take place \"no later than summer 2021,\" according to a statement from the IOC.\nAbe was speaking to reporters after a phone call with IOC President Thomas Bach on postponing the Games amid growing concerns over the coronavirus pandemic.\nTokyo had completed preparations when the virus started spreading across the world. Despite insisting for months the Games would go ahead as planned, Abe this week said a delay may be unavoidable if all the events could not be held. —Jabari Young, Reuters\nFutures contracts tied to the major U.S. stock indexes surged in premarket trading on hopes an agreement on a stimulus bill to rescue the economy from COVID-19 was close. As of 6:24 a.m ET., Dow Jones Industrial Average futures jumped 930 points, or 5%, to hit so-called limit up levels. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures were also up 5% and \"limit up.\" The S&P 500 SPDR ETF was up 5.1% in premarket trading. —Thomas Franck\nGilead Sciences' experimental drug remdesivir, seen as one of the more promising potential treatments for the coronavirus, received the orphan drug designation on Monday from the Food and Drug Administration. The announcement comes days after President Donald Trump called on the FDA to streamline its approval process for treatments such as remdesivir, which is currently being tested in clinical trials, with results expected as early as next month. The orphan drug status provides a seven-year market exclusivity period, as well as tax and other incentives for drug companies developing treatments for rare diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people. —Reuters\nTwo months after Chinese authorities locked down the city at the center of the outbreak, the end is in sight. Hubei province said that travel restrictions on the capital city of Wuhan will be removed starting April 8, which would end a lockdown that began on Jan. 23. New confirmed virus cases in China have dwindled in the last several days, with nearly all now attributed to travelers returning from overseas. —Evelyn Cheng\nItaly's death toll rose by 602, the smallest increase in four days, according to Reuters. The number of new confirmed cases also slowed. These figures have raised expectations that the worse could be over for the country with the highest number of deaths from the virus worldwide. However, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Italy had not yet reached the \"most acute phase\" of the infection.\nConte stepped up the national lockdown measures over the weekend, ordering the closure of all industrial production and almost all private and public offices. However, metalworkers and bank unions vowed to strike this week. They are demanding more stringent measures for the factories that are still open and for bank employees, who they say do not have enough masks, gloves or disinfectant. —Silvia Amaro\nThe number of new cases in Spain jumped Tuesday to 39,673 from 33,089 cases registered on Monday, the health ministry reported. The number of fatalities rose to 2,696 overnight from 2,182, the ministry said. —Reuters\nThe euro zone economy suffered \"an unprecedented collapse\" in business activity in March as the coronavirus outbreak intensified, according to provisional purchasing manager's index survey data from IHS Markit. The data showed that the \"flash\" euro zone composite PMI collapsed from 51.6 in February to 31.4 in March. The survey measures business activity in the services and manufacturing sector in the 19-member euro zone.  A reading below 50 indicates a contraction. This is the largest monthly fall in business activity since comparable data were first collected in July 1998. The prior low was seen in February 2009, when the index hit 36.2. —Holly Ellyatt\nIndonesia reported an additional 107 cases, marking the biggest daily increase for the Southeast Asian nation. It takes the country's total number of COVID-19 infections to 686. Seven further deaths from the virus in the last 24 hours means the nationwide death toll now stands at 55. —Sam Meredith\nThe U.K. government has tightened restrictions on the British public. As of Tuesday morning, all nonessential public buildings and places are closed, ranging from libraries to churches, outdoor gyms and playgrounds, and all social events including weddings and baptisms have been stopped. The public has been told to stay at home and can now only leave home for essential trips to buy food or medicines, to provide essential care, travel to work if absolutely necessary or to exercise once a day. —Holly Ellyatt\nRead CNBC's coverage from CNBC's Asia-Pacific and Europe teams overnight here: Britain goes into lockdown; global cases surpass 382,000"

    "content": "Arguments that exchange-traded funds increase market volatility or can even cause a market crash are popular these days, and the Facebook stock tanking provided one more chance for the ETF naysayers to make their case.\nIt also provided one more opportunity for Vanguard Group founder and index fund pioneer Jack Bogle to say it's most likely a bogus argument.\nThere are more than 100 ETFs with Facebook among their top holdings. There are more than 230 ETFs with exposure to Facebook. \nWhat does Bogle think of the latest ETF market crash Exhibit A?\n\"I'm gonna guess we don't know, but I will guess the answer is 'no,'\" Bogle told CNBC in an interview Thursday.\nThe reason is simple, and it's one Bogle has made before: active managers more or less replicate the indexes just like passive funds.\n\"If you look at the hot stocks, U.S. active managers own almost exactly the same as passive index managers, there's not much difference.\"\nThe ETF industry did experience net outflows in February and March, the first time since 2008 there were negative flows in two consecutive months. And Bogle did tell CNBC that in 66 years he has never seen volatility like this.\nHowever, \"most ETF investors are buy and hold investors (both advisory and retail accounts),\" noted Neena Mishra, head of ETF research at Zacks Investment Research. \nIndeed, Bogle told CNBC on Thursday that what we've seen in the market is lots of selling of Facebook shares, not lots of selling by ETFs. \nAt last year's annual Morningstar investment conference, Bogle answered a question about passive management's rise being a major risk to the market this way:\n\"If indexing even got up to 50 percent to 60 percent of the market ... still the markets would be efficient and work just fine.\" He went on: \"It's a reasonable question but there's no evidence it happens. All speculative managers hold Apple and Amazon and Alphabet. Active managers own roughly the same percentage of those stocks as the index weight ones. One doesn't want to be too dogmatic, but I don't believe there will be a significant impact.\"\nBogle does have one bone to pick with ETFs. He says they do encourage bad behavior, and that leads investors to lower returns than they can achieve with traditional index funds.\n\"We have had more and more speculators using ETFs to participate in the market. ... They turn over with fury.\"\nBogle cited numbers that could not be independently verified to make his case.\n\"The typical stock on the Big Board or Nasdaq turns over 180 percent to 200 percent a year. We have a trading mentality that should not affect long-term investors, but ETF investors have earned a 5 percent return in the last 12 years and investing in traditional index funds has returned about 8 percent. ... That gap means the traditional index fund investor earned 180 percent on their money and ETF investors about 100 percent. Eighty percentage points in 12 years. ... That's not a good game for anyone but the sellers,\" Bogle said.\nBen Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar, said he hasn't seen those numbers cited by Bogle, but Bogle is talking about an investing factor that he has studied: the gap between the returns the funds have generated (time-weighted returns) and the returns that investors, on average, have experienced in those same funds once you account for their buying and selling (cash-flow weighted returns).\nIn plain English, measuring the return of a fund without any trading action over time, versus the return of a fund based on investor flows into and out of a fund over time.\n\"The gap between the two (which we refer to as the behavior gap) is effectively a self-imposed penalty that investors suffer in their attempts to time the market,\" Johnson wrote in an email.\nJohnson has examined this relationship for index funds versus active funds, but he has not replicated Bogle's numbers using ETFs.\n\"The gap for ETFs vs. TIFs (as Bogle calls traditional index funds) is no doubt wider, given that the ETF investor base is much different and the use cases for ETFs are far more varied (hedging, shorting, arb trades, etc.) than those for TIFs (buy, hold, rebalance).\n\"He has always said the worst part of ETFs is that they becomes a trading vehicle that can hurt investors of any size, which contrary to the old index mutual funds, that can only be traded at the end of the day,\" said Drew Voros, editor-in-chief of ETF.com. But Voros also couldn't verify Bogle's numbers.\nZacks' Mishra pointed pointed out that this is not about an ETF inherently performing worse than a traditional index fund. The SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) had an annualized return of 9.6 percent over the past 10 years.\nVanguard Group was not able to immediately provide a source for the numbers cited by Bogle, but a Vanguard spokesman said it is extremely hard to decipher \"speculation\" from legitimate, short-term usage of ETFs; for example, for hedging and cash equitization.\nThe Bogle Center on Financial Markets Research could not be immediately reached. \nBogle has always adhered to the belief that one of the greatest determinants of investing success is keeping it simple — he has even criticized Vanguard Group on select occasions since retiring for launching more funds (both traditional index and ETF) than he thinks are necessary. The many ETFs, which are by nature more tradeable than traditional index funds, can lead investors to unnecessarily deviate from simple buy-and-hold behavior.\nThere was one comment Bogle made at last year's Morningstar conference that reinforces his belief that while ETFs get more of the attention these days — good and bad — traditional index funds still maintain the upper hand. \"The only funds growing faster than ETFs since 2011: traditional index funds,\" he said.\nMore from ETF Spotlight:In run on S&P 500, investors favor 3 stock and bond bets Biggest stocks were biggest losers in Q1Watch: How much has Boeing and China trade war hurt ETFs?"

    "content": "If there's one piece of advice that investors should take to heart, it's that they are almost invariably not smart enough to time the market. Going to cash means not just avoiding the Dow's worst days but missing out on the days of the biggest gains — usually only a few a year — and being left with the difficult task of trying to figure out when to get back into stocks.\nBut one thing investors have been doing that does make sense is cutting exposure to the S&P 500 — in a big way.\nExchange-traded fund investors bailed on the S&P 500 in March to the tune of near-$20 billion in outflows from two flagship large-cap stock index ETFs, which led outflows among all ETFs.  \nThe S&P 500 exodus in particular sends the message that large-cap stock leaders of this bull market are no longer a free lunch, and that makes sense — it's even a little late for those investors just getting the message about diversification and asset allocation. But a deeper dive into the ETF flows in March, and the ETF performance leaders this year, shows where investors who do believe in staying in the market are going rather than the S&P 500.\nHere are the three ETFs that led inflows, according to FactSet, in a brutal month that ensured the February-March period combined would be the first time there have been consecutive monthly outflows from ETFs since 2008 — and three straightforward lessons they reveal about investing.\n1. iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (IEFA): $5.2 billion2. iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM): $2 billion 3. iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (SHV): $1.8 billion\n1. Stock diversification means not limited exposure to the U.S. market, no matter what Buffett and Bogle say.2. If you insist on a U.S. stock-centric view of the world, at least accept that a trade war makes a good case for adding small-cap market exposure: It is a universe less exposed to overseas revenue.\n3. No matter how many times the traders and talking heads say the bull market in bonds is over and it's time to sell bonds, investors will flock to bonds in periods of uncertainty, and there was every reason to expect that after nine years of gains, a correction was in the cards. Bonds still are not doing well, but investors who want to maintain exposure to bonds have been shortening up on bonds they are holding.\nYear-to-date SHV is up, though not by much, and IEFA and IWM are both down, though by less than U.S. stock indexes. But the point is not to head to a hot bet, it's to have an investing plan that makes sense over the long term.\n\"Even long-term-focused investors are nervous now,\" said Neena Mishra, director of ETF Research at Zacks Investment Research. \"Factors that drove fund flows are easy to understand— small-cap outperformance due to trade concerns, international diversification and shortening of duration of bond portfolios,\" she said.\nThe S&P 500 outflows were led by the SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), which bled more than $10 billion, but the SPDR family has never been the best read on the individual investor as its history has been more closely associated with institutions and traders who were early into ETFs. The iShares ETFs, though are tools used by advisors. Its S&P 500 ETF saw more than $9 billion in outflows in March. \"The fact that iShares Core S&P had a big outflow, it looks to me that it's a reflection of advisor-led reallocating,\" said Mitch Goldberg, president of investment advisory firm ClientFirst Strategy.\nA look at what is doing well this year from a performance standpoint indicates why going with what's hot is hard to justify. Here are the top 5 ETFs year-to-date in performance, based on data from XTF.com, and excluding leveraged ETFs and ETNs.\n1. iShares Latin America 40 ETF (ILF): 10 percent2. iShares North American Tech Software ETF: 9.8 percnet3. Teucrium Agricultural Fund (TAGS): 9.7 percent4. First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index (FDN): 9.7 percent5. iShares MSCI Malaysia ETF (EWM): 9.6 percent\nAlso in the top 10 year-to-date: country funds for Vietnam, Nigeria and the United States Oil Fund (USO).\nAn investor can chase performance in emerging markets or make a commodities market bet, and that's fine for \"play\" money, but not core investing.\nThe First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index hasn't only been a big winner in terms of performance but in terms of flows as well, and remember that even as tech stocks get clobbered the tech sector within the S&P 500 isn't doing nearly as badly as most of S&P sectors this year. FDN and PowerShares Dynamic Software (PSJ) are both in the top 10 among ETFs this year. Long-term bets on tech do make sense. \"It [FDN] was one of the best-performing ETFs of the nine-year bull-run and continued its outperformance in Q1 as well,\" Mishra said.\nBut it is also the most popular ETF with significant exposure to the FANG stocks — not a place for investors to find additional comfort right now.\n\"The fact that oil rose during the quarter doesn't make it surprising that USO was in the top ten. ...  That certainly explains Nigeria being among the top ten as well,\" Goldberg said. \"As far as the software focused ETFs, I would expect their rankings to be pretty precarious with the tech sector in general taking a tumble.\"\nThere's no solution for a selloff, but sense is a better response than panic, or rashly going to cash. For investors who never got the message about not being 100 percent U.S. stocks during the past decade of good fortune, now is as good a time as any to learn it.  \nMore from ETF Spotlight:\nWatch: ETFs with the biggest exposure to AmazonThe market's biggest and best trade unraveled in the first quarterWatch: Where the momentum is in ETFs"

    "content": "Robinhood, the free-trading pioneer favored by younger traders, said it experienced an outage Monday.\nThe technical problems took up most of the trading day and were not fixed before the close. Robinhood clients missed out on the biggest one-day point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in history. \n\"We are experiencing a system-wide outage. We are working to resolve this issue as soon as possible,\" the company said in a message to clients Monday. With an hour left in the trading day, Robinhood updated clients saying, \"the issue has been identified and a fix is being implemented.\"\nThe outage came amid the market's attempt at a rebound from the worst week for stocks since the financial crisis fueled by investor panic surrounding the fast-spreading coronavirus. All three major averages climbed on Monday, closing out of correction territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 1,300 points, the most ever in a single session. \nThe Silicon-Valley start-up gained popularity with young investors by offering free stock trading in 2013. The Menlo Park, California-based company said in December that it has 10 million users on the platform. \n\"Your portfolio information is not available right now. Please check back later,\" read a Robinhood message to clients posted Monday on Twitter. Many other tweets showed the app with a blank, white screen. \nNews of Robinhood's outage came a week after Fidelity and Charles Schwab said they had technical difficulties amid an 800-point plunge by the Dow Jones Industrial Average. TD Ameritrade also said some of its clients were experiencing technical issues at that time last week. \nOne factor possibly contributing to these platforms' technical issues could be higher-than-average trading volumes. Last week, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) traded more than 200 million shares three times. On Friday, shares of the ETF changed hands more than 385 million times. Those numbers are well above the SPY's 30-day average volume of 97.3 million shares.\nRobinhood kicked off a wave of fee slashing in the broader brokerage industry with Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade and Fidelity dropping commission fees late last year.\n\"We're experiencing downtime, and are working to resolve this as quickly as possible,\" a Robinhood spokesperson told CNBC. \nUsers took to twitter to air their concerns about staying on the sidelines during the market rally on Monday.\ntweet\ntweet\n— With reporting from CNBC's Fred Imbert and Kate Rooney. \nSubscribe to CNBC PRO for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from around the world."

    "content": "There has been a lot of talk in the world of exchange-traded funds that giants like Vanguard Group, BlackRock's iShares and Charles Schwab are headed in the direction of trading without any management fee at all. We're not there yet, but Vanguard Group is making a major move related to ETF fees that no other firm has yet made. Starting in August, investors using Vanguard's online brokerage platform will be able to trade all ETFs on a commission-free basis, including ETFs from rivals iShares, Schwab and State Street Global Advisors.\nInvestors who use the online Vanguard platform can already buy an ETF for free and have been able to do that for a decade, though there are some restrictions to curb frequent trading for brokerage clients with less than $1 million in assets. But that frequent trading policy will eliminated at the same time the commission-free changes go into effect in August. There will be no limitations on trading of any ETFs — Vanguard or non-Vanguard.\nOther brokerage platforms have signed exclusive deals with specific ETF providers to offer commission-free trades as competition has increased, such as Fidelity Investments' tie-up with iShares, but no online platform has gone near this Vanguard move, which includes access to more than 100 ETF providers and roughly 1,800 ETFs of the roughly 2,000 in the market.\nYet there is one big exception: Vanguard will not offer commission-free access to leveraged or inverse ETFs. Vanguard said it was excluding the leveraged and inverse ETFS due to \"their speculative nature runs counter to our investors’ focus on long-term success.\"\n\"This is a significant move by Vanguard,\" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. \"Other brokerage firms, such as Schwab or TD Ameritrade, provide commission-free trades on a subset of ETFs, with the asset managers supplementing the cost savings.\"\nRosenbluth said the idea that Vanguard brokerage investors will be able to trade SSGA's SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) and iShares iBoxx High Yield (HYG) commission-free is not something CFRA expects other brokerage firms to follow, because it would require them to forgo their existing exclusive relationships.\n\"The ETF price war has been escalating and spreading to all corners. This is the latest salvo by Vanguard, one of the low-cost leaders in the ETF space, aimed at attracting new clients and then offering them other services, where they can make more money. It is a big development in the ETF price war,\" said Neena Mishra, director of ETF research at Zacks Investment Research.\nMishra does believe competitors will make moves in response and soon. But Vanguard also has an advantage in that it is an asset manager first and brokerage business second. Its business model relies less on brokerage revenue than stickiness of fund assets.\n\"Vanguard is more an asset manager that offers a smaller platform for trades to occur, whereas other firms profit more from the assets on and the trades via a brokerage platform. By moving to commission free for all, a brokerage firm forgoes some revenue in exchange for stickier assets,\" Rosenbluth said.\nE-Trade Financial offers commission-free trading on more than 250 ETFs. TD Ameritrade offers commission-free access to more than 300 ETFs.\nBoth Fidelity and Schwab have scale benefits of being both an asset manager and a brokerage platform for trading ETFs, Rosenbluth noted, but he could not speculate on how they would respond.\n\"Schwab and Fidelity are more likely to come up with similar moves,\" Mishra said. \"Both already have commission-free trading for their own ETFs as well as some other issuers.\"\nCharles Schwab was an early leader with 200-plus commission free ETFs, including its own ETFs and many ETFs from other major providers. Fidelity has 95 (its own and many iShares ETFs). \"Both are likely to expand these platforms soon,\" Mishra said.\nVanguard is making a greater play for the online brokerage business and noted in their release that it has made \"considerable enhancements\" to its brokerage platform over the past several years.\nWhile the move is a win for investors, it is also important for investors not to place all the emphasis on trading fees, especially as the fee wars at the level of the individual ETF and trading platform will continue. Similar ETFs in asset class or theme still vary in stock selection, liquidity and trading costs, among other factors. But it is hard to argue with what investors are telling these ETF companies.\nAccording to a recent annual Schwab ETF survey, 45 percent of millennial and 39 percent of Gen X investors surveyed say commission-free ETFs are most important and they'd move their account to a firm that offered commission-free.\n\"CFRA thinks investors need to go beyond what ETFs trade commission-free on certain platforms, but we acknowledge this is a priority for many,\" Rosenbluth said.\nThere is also a risk it becomes too easy and cheap to trade ETFs, something index fund creator and Vanguard founder Jack Bogle has remarked on repeatedly. \"Recent fund flows clearly show that investors are becoming more cost conscious and moving their dollars to the cheapest ETFs. And while there is no doubt that investors are big winners as the fee war escalates, the downside is that the ease of trading and low transaction costs are also leading investors to trade more often, particularly in volatile markets,\" Mishra said."

    "content": "As stocks continue to hit record highs, you may be thinking about taking up investing.\nSince the Covid-19 pandemic hit, investors have been piling into stocks and alternative investments such as cryptocurrency. Fully 15% of current retail investors began playing the stock market in 2020, according to a Charles Schwab analysis of 500 investors.\nIt's easy to get caught up in the excitement. The S&P 500 jumped more than 14% the first half of 2021. Then there is the hype surrounding meme stocks, like AMC, which hit all-time highs in June, and GameStop, which ran up earlier this year.\nYet experts caution about blindly following the crowd.\nMore from Invest in You:Holding too much cash isn't growing your personal wealth. Do this insteadMany Americans think kids will be financially worse off than their parentsStock market volatility can be an opportunity for investors. Here's why\nFor investing legend Charles Ellis, author of the  book \"Winning the Loser's Game,\" the key to investing is keeping it simple.\n\"Most of us do way too much decision-making about investing,\" he told CNBC contributor Jenny Harrington in an interview for CNBC Pro. (Harrington is CEO of New Canaan, Connecticut-based Gilman Hill Asset Management.)\n\"Fewer instructions works better,\" added Ellis, an advocate of passive investing, such as index funds, over active investing. \"Fewer decisions work better.\"\nSome new investors are looking to make rapid trades or try to time the market. However, starting slowly and understanding the  importance of diversification and asset classes is what certified financial planner Crystal Alford-Cooper tries to impress upon her clients.\n\"This is the age of distraction,\" said Alford-Cooper, who is vice president of planning at Glen Echo, Maryland-based Law & Associates. \"In your mind, you need to stay away from the noise and stay focused and disciplined about the things you can control.\"\nFor those just getting into the stock market, Ellis advises starting with the basics.\n\"It's a little bit like 'how do you start eating ice cream?'\" said Ellis, founder and former managing partner of Greenwich Associates. \"You start eating vanilla, and plain vanilla would be either the total market index or the Standard and Poor's 500 Index, which represents a very substantial fraction of the total market.\"\nGilman Hill Asset Management's Harrington agrees.\n\"As with most things in life, you're not going to be an expert on day one, and with around 7,000 ETFs and 3,500 stocks publicly traded in the U.S., it can feel overwhelming to make a choice,\" she said.\nHarrington recommends starting with something like the SPDR S&P 500 exchange-traded fund, which replicates the broad market.\nIf you are buying stocks, pick a handful that you know and where the underlying companies have proven track records.\n\"Start with investments that are easily understandable and use that foundation to learn more and to develop your investment understanding and vocabulary over time,\" Harrington advised.\nFor Alford-Cooper, one of the most important things to have is a written investment plan that works with your risk appetite. Then, stick with it.\n\"You can pick a great index fund that has companies that you know and use every day,\" she said. \"Keep away from people telling you what they do and what they made last year.\"\nSIGN UP: Money 101 is an 8-week learning course to financial freedom, delivered weekly to your inbox.\nCHECK OUT: Nearly half of Americans selling their homes don't plan to buy another: Here's what they're doing instead via Grow with Acorns+CNBC\nDisclosure: NBCUniversal and Comcast Ventures are investors in Acorns."

    "content": "Stocks moved higher on Tuesday as pandemic lockdowns continued to ease. Shares of shopping center and mall operators led the gains, while big technology companies lagged behind as investors rotated out of stay-at-home bets. Wall Street also grappled with civil unrest around the country. \nHere's what happened.\nStocks rose in the final minutes of trading and closed at the highs of the day as the economy's reopening continued to fuel optimism in the market. The Dow jumped 267 points for a gain of 1%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.8%. The Nasdaq was the relative underperformer as shares of some of the biggest tech names took a breather. The tech-heavy index gained 0.59% for the day, after earlier trading as much as 0.84% lower. – Stevens\nShares of Tiffany slid more than 9% following a report from WWD that LVMH's deal to acquire the jeweler seems uncertain, the publication said citing sources. The two companies initially reached a deal in November, with LVMH agreeing to purchuse Tiffany for $135 per share, or $16.2 billion in cash. At the time, LVMH said that \"the acquisition of Tiffany will strengthen LVMH's position in jewelry and further increase its presence in the United States.\" According to WWD, questions have since arisen based on weakness in the U.S. market. – Stevens\nThe Russell 1000 value index outperformed its growth counterpart in the final two weeks of May and that trend could continue, according to Savita Subramanian, Bank of America's head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy. The \"month Value rally could have legs,\" said Subramanian. \"In 14 of the last 14 recessions, Value has outperformed growth for at least 3 months when the economy showed signs of improving.\" The Russell 1000 value index remains, however, more than 15% lower for the year while the Russell 1000 growth index has gained 5.5%. —Imbert\n\nBank of America's Stephen Suttmeier said in a note Tuesday the S&P 500, which is up about 40% since hitting a March low, has \"room to run before becoming overbought.\" Suttmeier pointed out that \"sector outperformance has become more broad-based\" since the market plunge earlier this year, making for a \"healthier market.\" —Imbert\nOil jumped on Tuesday, as easing lockdown measures as well as an upcoming meeting from OPEC and its oil-producing allies supported prices. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, gained 3.87%, or $1.37, to settle at $36.81 per barrel. Earlier in the session it hit a high of $36.89, a level not seen since March 6. International benchmark Brent crude settled 3.26% higher at $39.57 per barrel, also the highest since March. The move higher comes amid reports that OPEC+ is considering extending its production cuts of 9.7 million barrels per day when they meet this month, rather than tapering cuts beginning July 1, which the group initially agreed to at its April meeting. – Stevens\nAbout three stocks advanced for every decliner at the New York Stock Exchange as Wall Street built on its solid start to June. About 2,060 NYSE-listed stocks were higher while 804 traded lower, according to FactSet data. —Imbert\nThe major averages were slightly higher with about an hour left in the trading session as stocks continued their solid start to the new month. The Dow traded 148 points higher, or 0.6%, while the S&P 500 advanced 0.4%. The Nasdaq climbed 0.2%. Bets on the economy reopening outweighed concerns in the market about the civil unrest across the U.S. —Imbert\nWith less than two hours left in the session, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF has only traded 40 million shares, compared with its 30-day trading volumes average of nearly 97 million shares, according to FactSet. The relatively thin trading came after the market scored back-to-back monthly gains, with the S&P 500 bouncing nearly 40% off its March low. Summer months also usually see seasonally slow trading.—Li\nExchange-traded funds that track corporate or government debt took in a record $28.5 billion in May, bringing the total inflows over the past two months to more than $50 billion, according to data from State Street Global Advisors. Investors piled in to bond ETFs in a historic pace on the back of the Federal Reserve's commitment to support the credit market.The central bank has launched emergency programs that include purchases of corporate debt ETFs and high-yielding securities to keep credit flowing. Flanked by the Fed's backstop, companies are racing to issue new debt, which has surpassed $1 trillion this year, double the pace of last year. \"Credit may actually be one avenue to seek out a return without overextending a portfolio in an idiosyncratic market,\" Matthew Bartolini, State Street's head of SPDR Americas Research, said in a note. He added investment-grade credit is up 13% since the market lows in March. \"It is a market segment that has both explicit and implicit support from the central bank,\" Bartolini said. – Li\nThe Dow and S&P 500 were slightly higher in midday trading as traders continue to grapple with civil unrest in the U.S. and the economy reopening. The 30-stock Dow gained 140 points, or 0.6% while the S&P 500 advanced 0.2%. Those gains were led in large part by stocks that benefit from the economic reopening. However, the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.4% as shares of major tech companies declined. —Imbert\nInvestment firm Stifel upped its price target on the home furnishing retailer to $265 from $150 ahead the company's earnings report on Thursday. \"RH is a high ticket business and outlet sales are expected to be a 4 point drag on 2020 revenues, but the stock market has rebounded and many are moving out of big cities, which could benefit RH,\" analyst John Baugh said. \"We had previously modeled revenue to be down 20%, 35%, 20%, and 5% in the 2020 quarters for a total reduction of 20% for the year and now believe this to be too drastic. We only see a 15% decline in Q1 now and 5% for the year,\" he said. - Bloom\nThe biggest tech and internet companies, which had led the market comeback over the past two months, underperformed on Tuesday as investors focus on the economic reopening and rotate out of the stay-at-home plays. Shares of Amazon dipped 0.8%, while Facebook fell 1.7%. Apple, Netflix, Microsoft and Alphabet all came under pressure on Tuesday, weighing on the Nasdaq Composite, which was down 0.3%. The tech-heavy benchmark has outpaced the S&P 500 so far this year, rising about 6% in 2020 and sitting just 3% below its record high.–Li\nWayfair's stock has jumped more than 12% in early trading after Piper Sandler raised its price target on the stock and CNBC's Jim Cramer said the company was part of a 'backyard trade' created by the coronavirus pandemic. The shift toward more outside activities because of the pandemic has \"rescued\" Wayfair, Cramer said on \"Squawk on the Street.\" —Pound\nAs parts of the U.S. start to reopen, shares of shopping center and mall operators jumped on Tuesday. Vornado Realty rose more than 3%. Federal Realty and SL Green Realty gained 4.9% and 4.3%, respectively. Mall operator Simon Property Group also ticked up more than 3.5%. — Fitzgerald \nThe financials are helping to lead gains as the lagging sector continues to draw in new money. Big banks like JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo were all higher. Other financial plays like Visa and Mastercard were also rising. The S&P financial sector was up 1.2% Tuesday morning, the third best performing major sector after energy and materials.  Year-to-date, the sector is the second worst, down 22%. Financials have been getting a lift as investors trade away from technology and look for beaten down areas that would be helped by an improving economy. —Domm\nShares of Lowe's rose more than 2% on Tuesday, to hit a new all-time intraday high. The company has benefited from strength in the housing industry as states around the country begin to reopen their economies, as well as recent data that's shown a greater-than-expected number of people buying houses. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB) has gained more than 50% this quarter, putting it on track for its best quarter on record. – Stevens\nShares of Western Union jumped more than 12% on Tuesday after a Bloomberg News report said the provider of money-transfer services has made a takeover offer for peer MoneyGram. The deal could combine two of the largest U.S. players in the space. No decision has been made, the report said. The news sent MoneyGram shares surging more than 30% in morning trading on Tuesday. – Li\nU.S. economic activity contracted by more than half due to efforts to contain the coronavirus, according to the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow gauge. The tracker is now estimating second-quarter GDP to shrink by 52.8% following data Monday showing a continued decline in manufacturing. One upside to the plunge could be a stronger rebound in the short term, said Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research. He is projecting a 20% GDP surge in the third quarter and another 5% in Q4, followed a slower \"swoosh\" pattern after that. – Cox\nTalks between Uber and Grubhub are ongoing, and progress is being made on the possible merger of the two companies, CNBC's David Faber has learned. Uber first made an offer to buy the food delivery company in May, and as talks continue, people familiar with the matter said that Grubhub is focused on protecting its business during  what could be a potentially long anti-trust review. The price expectations have narrowed, according to those familiar with the matter, and the two companies seem to be getting closer to a ratio that would be agreeable to both. – Stevens \nShares of athletic retailer Dick's Sporting Goods jumped more than 3% on Tuesday after the company said its e-commerce sales more than doubled in the first quarter. The online sales were a bright spot amid Covid-19 related store closures.  Dick's added that the current quarter has gotten off to a strong start. The company, however, reported dismal quarterly results. Dick's lost $1.71 per share, wider than the 57 cent loss expected on Wall Street, according to Refinitiv. Revenue and comparable-store sales also missed estimates. —Fitzgerald \nPro Subscribers can read more here. — Bloom\nU.S. equities opened in the green on Tuesday as investors continued to pile into riskier assets as the economy tried to reopen. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 130 points at the opening bell. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively. — Fitzgerald \nThere are multiple IPOs expected to raise roughly $1 billion or more this week as the market rebound and lower volatility has made companies and investors more confident in going public. The last U.S. IPO to raise more than $1 billion was GFL Environmental, which debuted on March 3, according to the Nasdaq's website.Warner Music Group, whose offering will be priced tonight, will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker WMG, and has an estimated pricing range of $23 to $26 per share, according to securities filings. ZoomInfo will also trade on the Nasdaq, under the symbol NI. The expected pricing range is $19 to $20 per share, according to securities filings, and it is slated to begin trading on Thursday. —Pound\nShares of Microsoft jumped nearly 1% in premarket trading on Tuesday after Wells Fargo said it believes Microsoft's market capitalization can top $2 trillion in the next few years due to strength in its cloud business. The Wall Street firm — which has an overweight rating on the Satya Nadella technology giant — said the coronavirus \"has created a Zeitgeist moment for the cloud as a whole,\" and Microsoft's Azure is poised to benefit. With growth in cloud revenue, Microsoft's market capitalization can reach $2.2 trillion by 2023, the firm said. Wells Fargo has an overweight rating on the stock and hiked hiked its 12-month price target on Microsoft to $250 per share from $205 per share. —Fitzgerald\nBank of America said in a note that its clients were net buyers of stocks for a second week in a row as investors plowed money into ETFs. Overall, clients increased their exposure to stocks by $60 million in assets as ETFs had an inflow of $1.044 billion, offsetting the sale of single-stock holdings. —Imbert, Bloom\nShares of stocks poised to benefit from the economy reopening ticked higher in premarket trading on Tuesday. Airlines, cruise lines and casino stocks all rose, in hopes that the reopening will bring a return to travel demand. Norwegian Cruise Line jumped more than 3% and Carnival and Royal Caribbean gained more than 2%. American Airlines, Southwest and Alaska Air jumped 2% each and United and Delta rose about 1.5%. —Fitzgerald\nOil moved higher on Tuesday, ahead of the meeting between OPEC and its oil-producing allies, where the current production cut policy will be discussed. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. oil benchmark, rose 3% to hit $36.51 per barrel, its highest level since March 6. Meanwhile international benchmark Brent crude rose to $39.55, a level not seen since March 11. \"OPEC+ cuts are clearly working with solid help from recovering crude oil demand, especially in Asia. An extension of the current cut levels will definitely be a further boost for the market. Not only will the market rebalance, but stock builds of oil will also feel some relief. Prices rise on this prospect and are set for higher levels if the cuts are indeed extended,\" said Bjornar Tonhaugen, head of oil markets at Rystad Energy. \"Bottom line is that the market is on a recovery path. If OPEC+ extends the high-level oil production cuts, that recovery will speed up and prices won't lag behind.\" —Stevens\nShares of Slack rose 3.8% in premarket trading after Cowen initiated the stock with an outperform rating and a $45 price target. The price target is 21% above where trading closed on Monday. The firm said in a note that the shift to working from home during the pandemic has expanded the potential market for Slack and that Wall Street is overly worried about competition from Microsoft Teams. Slack is set to report its fiscal first quarter results after the bell on Thursday.  —Pound\nShares of Zoom Video gained 3% during Tuesday's premarket trading, ahead of the company's first quarter earnings results, which will be released after the market closes. According to estimates from FactSet, analysts are expecting the company to earn 9 cents per share, on $202.3 million in revenue. The stock gained 13.75% on Monday, hitting a new all-time high, and breaking above $200 for the first time. The video-conferencing company has seen its user base jump amid the coronavirus pandemic, and shares have gained 200% this year. –Stevens\nStock futures rose on Tuesday morning as traders focused on the economic reopening and looked past the civil unrest in the U.S. Stocks that would benefit from the economic restart — such as airlines, cruise lines, some retailers and banks — led the early gains. The market has largely ignored the unrest across the U.S. However, that could change if traders believe protest could continue through the summer, potentially hurting the reopening and dampening consumer confidence. —Imbert\n—With reporting from Maggie Fitzgerald, Yun Li and Jeff Cox. \nSubscribe to CNBC PRO for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from around the world.i"

    "content": "Hedge fund strategies utilize a range of approaches to maximize returns on market swings. And while the funds are traditionally targeted at accredited investors, they are now becoming more accessible through ETFs.\nNew York-based firm Dynamic Beta investments runs the iMGP DBi Hedge Strategy ETF (DBEH) in the U.S. The fund uses futures contracts to model the performance of 40 equity long/short hedge funds to deliver equity-like returns over time.\n\"The idea is really smart guys are going to know not just what stocks to buy, but what stock to short,\" Andrew Beer, founder of Dynamic Beta investments, told Bob Pisani on CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" on Monday.\n\"Our conclusion was that most of what they get right are big shifts in the market,\" Beer said. \"They get off the tracks as the train is coming down.\"\nBeer explained that when interest rates start to go up, spooked investors deviate from FAANG stocks that are dependent upon low rates to emerging markets and value stocks. To counter that, DBEH employs a diversified pool of funds to better identify factor shifts.\n\"If we get that right and put it into an ETF, we've given an allocator a really valuable tool because it's less risky than equities but can generate equity-like returns over time,\" he said.\nWhile the fund emulates hedge fund strategies, it operates index-based futures contracts rather than individual stocks. Beer explained that the approach materializes an expanding need from traders going forward.\n\"Sixty/forty and being long stocks and bonds did incredibly well for a decade,\" he said. \"We're trying to give you the building blocks where you can say, 'I want this much in this strategy, I want that much in that strategy.' It's as simple as investing in an S&P 500 ETF. That's what we're trying to do.\"\nDisclaimer"
